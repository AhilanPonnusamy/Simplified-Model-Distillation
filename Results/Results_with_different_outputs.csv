"My husband and I have stayed at Harrahs a few times. This time we brought our kids and booked a \""classic\"" 2 queen bed room. This room is actually much quieter and bigger then their \""high roller\"" or \""premium\"" rooms, which is weird. There is no desk but there is a little table with 2 chairs. It's not fully updated but honestly it's not bad at all. I would book this room again if we had a choice of the other rooms. I didn't give 5 stars because the bathroom tub kept dripping water. It wasn't loud or anything but it was a minus.",positive,neutral,negative
I booked here with a very good deal from expedia and it was on the LV strip. That's why I chose there. It wasn't that bad but if it wasn't on the strip I would look for somewhere else.,neutral,neutral,negative
"My boyfriend and I came here for one of his many birthday dinners in Vegas. \n\nWe did not have reservations so we sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks for about 15 minutes before our table was ready. The bar tender was quick to get us our drinks and was very attentive.\n\nWe were sat outside in the mall area. The boyfriend and I are major people watchers and I guess it was prom night for some local high school. We watched countless girls no older than 17 parade around looking like whores. Needless to say we had a good amount of laughs. \n\nThe bread basket was enough food that we didn't need to order appetizers. For two people, it was seriously bread overkill. What I did appreciate was UNSALTED butter offered with a side of coarse sea salt on the side. This is exactly what I do at home. I'm a butter snob and I refuse to touch salted butter unless there are no other available options.\n\nI ordered the spaghettini, which was delicious. Very simple, but done the from-scratch way, therefore perfection.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the half roasted chicken on mashed potatoes. His was very simple but also delicious. \n\nI love restaurants like Spago, that offer some really classic and simple dishes but made with high quality ingredients with very high standards. The potions were large as well and well priced. There are other things on the menu I'd like to try, so I suppose on my next Vegas trip I'll be stopping in again.",positive,neutral,negative
"Came Thanksgiving weekend to watch the Sting concert at the Colosseum. After the concert, we decided to grab a bite at Spago's. Surprisingly, we only ordered two entrees (Those who know me well, know that I usually go ALL out and order a few appetizers, entrees, and desserts. My eyes are ALWAYS bigger than my stomach!). \n\nThe bolognese pasta with fresh ricotta cheese was oh-so yummy. I usually don't order meat sauces because I can make that stuff anytime at home...However, I'm glad I ordered this entree, which was cooked al dente and the amount of sauce didn't overpower the pasta itself. The portion was reasonable too.\n\nThe fairly thin-crusted prosciutto pizza with baby arugula was yummy too! The prosciutto tasted fresh and not dried out. Only request I have is if there was more prosciutto on the pizza!!! LOVE, LOVE prosciutto!\n\nThe complimentary bread and crackers were delish too...the onion bread was good to dip into my pasta dish.\n\nThese two entrees including tax came out to exactly $40. \n\nWill come again!",positive,neutral,negative
"Spectacular food and service. We started with the blue shrimp salad which was prepared with an orange sauce - out of this world! My wife had the veal and I had the ahi tuna, both were marvelously presented and tasted phenomenal. Eat bite was savored. We pair our meals with the four vine Chardonnay (meat), and the Pinot noir (fish). Great choices. For dessert we had the apple crumble prepared in a bourbon sauce. That was the only part of the meal we would only give four stars. Everything else was five star.\n\nThe one drawback was the overwhelming noisy atmosphere. Might be their design intention though. We would recommend!",positive,neutral,negative
"In my 8 years living in Las Vegas, I never had a chance to try Spago. I view it as a bit out of price range, so when their 20 Year Anniversary came up with roll-back pricing, I had to try it. Went last night with my date, and we asked the assistant GM Drew to pick our food. Here's what he picked, and my thoughts on each:\n\nSignature Roasted Beet Goat Cheese Salad\nI never would have ordered this but it was delicious.\n\nHouse Smoked Sturgeon, Crisp Potato Galette, Horseradish Cream - $12\nIt was like a spicy latke with fish on top. Really good.\n\n\n\""Chinois Style\"" Colorado Lamb Chops, Cilantro Mint Vinaigrette, Sweet & Sour Eggplant - $33\nTender and delicious even without the sauce. Eggplant was so good my date and I couldn't figure out if it was eggplant!\n\nCantonese Style Roasted Duck with Wild Huckleberries, Ginger and Stir-Fried Baby Bok Choy - $20\nHuge and delicious, and unexpected as we thought we were only getting 1 main course to share. Needless to say we had plenty of leftovers.\n\nEven with the discount I spent a bit more than I had hoped, but everything was delicious and the service was great, as well. Oh, and they have an amazing bread platter. Wish I was hungrier and got to try more of that!\n\nThanks, Drew W & Scott G!",positive,neutral,negative
"Came here with hubs and the inlaws. OMG. Everything was amazing and everyone loved their food! Service was awesome and the chef even came by to check on us.\n\nWild mushroom risotto...mmmmmmmm!!!! My lamb chops were killer. Even the sun dried tomatoes were tasty and fresh. Hubs got the duck breast....ohhhh...myyyyy.....GAWD! My father-in-law's New York steak, even though he likes med well and I'm a med rare person, was still delicious. Mom-in-law got some fish dish, and I don't eat seafood but her plate was empty, so she obviously loved it. We shared the chocolate layer cake dessert which came with some salted caramel gelato...yum!\n\nWe were hurtin' so good afterward! This place is a must on our next trip to Vegas. One of the best dinners ever!!!",positive,neutral,negative
"Bah, a better word for this place would be \""SALT.\""\n\nFrom the salt covered butter that's served with the bread, to the salt drenched salad, arriving at the salty, uninspiring pepperoni pizza, all I could taste was salt. \n\nIt gets two stars simply for the servers, who were awesome and kind people. At least the water they provided was salt-less and helped re-hydrate me.",negative,neutral,positive
"i dont know if im super spoiled from eating in san francisco all the time or what. but i thought this place was terrible. as soon as i got in, you could definitely sense some attitude from the servers. if the food is good, i really wouldn't mind or care. i ordered the scallop special as a starter and got a sweet potato tortelloni with shortribs from their tasting menu. was also able to try stuff off their regular menu such as the pork, veal, salmon and desserts. the food was very underwhelming. i usually spare no expense when it comes to food, and pay very little attention to my bills usually. but this place was just ridiculous. it was marked up because of its vegas location. even without the markups, the food would have been nowhere near worth the price. \n\nthe flavors were very bland and did not contrast well as i would expect fine foods to. there was nothing surprising about the flavors out of every dish i tried. actually, there were even parts of my pasta that were not fully cooked. im a huge fan of the al dente, but hard pasta is not good in my opinion. maybe i went on an off night. food aside, having the staff trying to push every little charge on you isnt my idea of a nice experience.\n\nin addition, my friend asked for sorbet for dessert. they gave her 2 or 3 scoops of fruit sorbet for $16.....i don't know about that.",negative,neutral,positive
"There seems to be only one listing for this place here on Yelp, but to be accurate (as some others have noted) there are two places, the fancier and pricier Valentino and the more casual and cheaper Grill @ Valentino, we were considering taking in the fine dining option, but after viewing the menu, we just weren't feeling anything, so we went with the grill.\n\nService was a bit spotty, our waiter brought our water and immediately asked about our wine selection, before we had gotten a chance to view the list. Then, after bringing us our appetizer and salad course, was nowhere to be found when we wanted to order entrees. \n\nThe food, however, was very good. This place boasts one the best alfredo sauces I've had on the strip, and while it's not a particularly fancy option, it's something that many places don't do that well. Caesar salad was crisp and light and everything was generally what you'd expect from a casual italian place",positive,neutral,negative
"There is nothing wrong with this place. But there is nothing extraordinary either. To be quite honest, I dined there with my mom, because we had a 20% coupon. Why not?\n\nThe service was great; we had a couple of waiters, and for having to work during the holidays (I went during Christmas time), they were upbeat and knowledgeable.\n\nThe food, on the other hand, was nothing amazing. I got a side of roasted vegetables drizzled with Balsamic Vinegar, and it was fine. I also had a special ravioli of the day, which had an interesting flavor, but the texture was a bit on the chewier side. It did taste nice, but I was not overly impressed.\n\nOverall, nothing was too spectacular about this place, but it tasted fine. It is a little on the pricier side for the quality of food you get, but we had a coupon, so I wasn't too bummed about that!",neutral,neutral,positive
"The food was ok, ordered couple of appetizers, dinner and wine was thinking it was going to be great, but I was not impressed at all! Place was nice and clean, Server was nice..\nI don't think I would ever come back here, but I can atlest say I tried it .",negative,neutral,positive
"Great mexican fare, absolutely tasty and well executed. Great for lunch, not sure I would have dinner there, in the Canal Shoppes mall, unless you really want to see and hear the gondoliers on and on. A bit pricey for classic mexican food, no matter how good, so rating is set at 3.",neutral,neutral,positive
"Just came to pass the time with a drink. Nice location on the grand canal inside the Venetian, great ambience. \n\nThe margarita, advertised as \""the best in town\"", was definitely not, but for $5 at happy hour, was a good value. \n\nChips were standard out of a bag probably, but the salsa was good with some roasted pepper in there.\n\nUPDATE: Despite not being a featured happy hour drink, I ordered the jalape\u00f1o-infused margarita. MUCH better, the ingredients seem fresher (the Classic was too syrupy). The jalape\u00f1o-infused has fresh orange and cilantro in it for an interesting twist.",positive,neutral,negative
"Oh The Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes. I have brought many a family member and friend here just to walk around and gawk at things. I have never, not once, bought something here. I am sure other locals will not be surprised by this omission, as I am sure other locals would say the same thing.\n\nThe gondola rides have been around forever it seems and I have yet to step foot on one. However, it is fun to giggle at the tourists floating around in a fake Venice. I suppose if I had the expendable cash it would be a cute thing to do, but considering how long I've gone without doing the gondola ride, my expectations of really doing it are very low.\n\nI feel as though the Canal Shoppes are set up strangely and I always get lost. I've been in this place probably 20+ times and I still get lost. Especially now that they have been linked to the Palazzo Shoppes. \n\nPlus, I am sorry, but I just cannot get over the baby-hooker smell of The Venetian/Grand Canal Shoppes. Yes, I have dubbed it baby-hooker smell. I don't care what The Venetian thinks it smells like, it smells like baby-hooker.",negative,neutral,neutral
"Los Antojos just got a killer review by John Curtas: eatinglasvegas.com http://www.eatinglv.com/2009/07/los-antojos/ Congratulations!  This is actually it's 2nd great article in a couple of weeks -- the first as a shout out from Alex Stratta in Las Vegas Weekly.\n\nIf only all the great mom & pop places in Vegas/Henderson, could get their 15 minutes -- \n\noh right, that's what Yelp's supposed to be...but all you bozos keep writing about are the big strip joints to get your review counts up. And the rest have covered In n Out enough to last an eternity.  Oh, and don't forget the myriad of idiots who order wrong at Lotus, then trash it. Seriously, you think we can't tell...?!\n\nPlease, people. Broaden your horizons. There are great gems still waiting to be discovered.",neutral,neutral,negative
"The food is made to order and tastes great. It's a small place and based on the food alone, is probably busy all the time.",positive,neutral,negative
"A friend of mine had recommended checking this place out due to the prices being fair and usually lower than all the competitors. I had also heard that they did consignment and decided that the old W.W. Greener that I had could possibly find a new home through them. \n\nAfter walking in I noticed that it has a different feel than most gun shops in town. All of the other shops I have been in have the concrete grey floors and the very minimalist/Bunkeresque feel to them. It seemed to me like they try to make this place feel a little more inviting, it could just be that the place had wood floors and and a different feel when they leased the place but it works. \n\nI presented my shotgun to the clerk on duty and he was very knowledgeable and friendly when it came to researching the gun and giving me a strait forward answer. He had mentioned that He could put it on the shelves but due to where we live and what people want that unless it is an assault rifle that looks like the ones in the video games it will probably sit for quite some time but he would recommend listing it myself on Gun Broker and sure enough I did and it sold.\n\nA took a few minutes to chat with the guy before walking around and checking out accessories, which I must add, they were definitely not cheaper than other shops when it came to those. I priced a Black Hawk Paddle holster and it was insanely marked up but the guns seem to be okay. \n\nI would go back here if I needed to consign something or get some quick gun advice but no necessarily for accessories or ammo",positive,neutral,negative
"I'm not a big sports fan. In fact, I'm not a sports fan (I watch for cheerleaders, car crashes when my wife isn't around). We had a group dinner here, but our reservations got messed up and our group of 13 was going to be put at two separate tables. After some protracted negotiation, we were put in a small glassed off room.\n\nFrom then on, it was a good experience. The food menu was largely burgers (and some of the best buffalo wings I have had in a long time) and large beers (24 ouncers).\n\nAfterwards, we headed upstairs to the gaming zone, an area with sports-ish video games. It was a little weird playing video games iwth co-workers, but we had a blast on the different driving games.\n\nIf sports on TV is your thing, this is your place. Otherwise, its just another okay restaurant with lots of TVs on the multiple ESPN stations.",neutral,neutral,negative
It was good........we were all hungry after hanging at the pool all day so we wanted a quick bite to eat.....\n\nthe nachos came out fast but the rest took a little while.\n\nI had the chicken tenders salad which made me wonder why didn't i just order the chicken tenders ha!\n\nAt least the boys had a good view of the TV :),neutral,negative,positive
"ESPN Zone has cool concept. Eat while watching your favorite sports teams. We came here last week to watch the Warriors game. My cousin's 4 year old son Loves the warriors. He can sit through a whole game and knows most of the players. I think its pretty amazing. So after leaving him in this kids place most of the day we thought he would enjoy ESPN Zone for dinner. \n\nThe food was actually not bad. But nothing spectacular. I usually list everything off but I'm not going to b/c that's all you really need to know. It's bar food. \n\nThe service actually is not good. The waiter even gave my mother attitude when she asked him about a drink. He might not have heard her b/c the place is loud but attitude was not necessary. \n\nThe TV at the table was pretty cool. They have all these different feeds and you can chose what you want to watch. We were however having some volume issues. All we could hear was the booth's next to us feed. And yes, I did try to raise the volume using the touch pad tv screen. It wasn't working.",neutral,neutral,negative
"The location is pretty decent and you don't have to deal with any casinos or smoke. the morning breakfast is very good and the suites are clean and well-appointed. the breakfast has waffles, eggs, potatoes, juices, yogurt, etc. and will fill you up.\n\n the only complaint is that they keep trying to push the travel club on you. they leave messages on your phone (it woke me up at 8AM on Saturday morning!) and push it on you if you ask them any questions.",positive,neutral,negative
"Overall everything here was OK. The hotel needs to be renovated, I think the staff does a good job with working with what they have, but the rooms themselves feel a little rundown, the furniture is worn etc...\n\nThe room at least felt clean and the location is great. It is within walking distance to the strip, but not on it, yet they have plenty of stuff to eat literally right outside the parking lot. \n\nThe staff here was friendly and everything else was good.",neutral,neutral,positive
"This is the main store, but it's also in a few strip clubs around town including my club (rhino) good selection of clothes, shoes, and jewelry. Sadly, I wish some of the people were friendlier. And they had more of a selection if clothes. I dont know maybe that's just me.",neutral,neutral,negative
"This was the first store we hit when we got to Fashion Show Mall.\n\nWe dont have a Hot Topic in Canada. I always enjoy going to stores we don't have.\n\nThis location wasn't overly big. Mostly Tshirts, cheap jewelry and \""Mall GothFashion\""\n\nI wasn't in the mood to try any clothes on or I would of checked out a few skirts I saw.\n\nWe only bought a few cosmetic items, bright blue & green liquid eyeliner, and a white eyeshadow. They were all on clearance which is funny since I only use high end cosmetics. But I had forgot some of my makeup at home, and brightly colored liquid liner is sometimes hard to find.\n\nThe girl who rang us up had super cool nails. She wasnt overly friendly but did tell us how the salon did the tips all glittery.\n\nI now kinda wish I would of tried that skirt on ... Hmmm another reason to return to Vegas sooner, then later.",positive,neutral,negative
"3 stars for the revolving carousel bar. \n\n\""Bazooko's Circus is what the whole hep world would be doing Saturday nights if the Nazis had won the war. This was the Sixth Reich. \""",neutral,neutral,negative
"I knew what I was getting into when I booked reservations at this hotel so I can't really say I was surprised at the experience. I was expecting dumpy, run down, lots of kids and probably not that great of service and that's basically what we got. \n\nWhy'd I still go ahead and book my reservation? Frightdome. Frightdome was one of the big reasons we came to Vegas on this trip. So we figured \""Might as well book a room in the same hotel that Frightdome will be in so we can just crawl back to our rooms when all is said and done.\"" and that's basically what we did. \n\nWe booked a room for Saturday night. Arrived a couple of hours before Frightdome was set to open, dropped our bags off in the room and actually rested a bit. To be honest...the rooms were actually pretty decent and the walls must have been super thick because I never heard anyone in the hallway or in the rooms around us the entire time. \n\nThe hotel/casino itself like I stated before is rundown and just not a pleasant experience. But on the upside it was a 10 minute walk from our room to Frightdome. Check in was a nightmare. They only had two people checking people in. We got in about a 20 person line and by the time we got up to the desk the line had doubled. When I commented about the lack of staff the person checking us in said that the hotel had made lots of cuts. Wonderful. \n\nOh, well. We had a decent night's sleep and got the hell out of dodge come 8am.",neutral,neutral,negative
"Ehh... maybe it is because I have low standards, and that I have lived a lifestyle in which the toilet was literally a hole in the ground for me to pee on, but I did not have much of a problem with staying here. There are honestly superior hotels in the strip, but if you've lived in a straw hut like I did you'd at least be thankful that your stuff will be safe whilst you enjoy Vegas.\n\nYou're not visiting Vegas to sulk in a pretty hotel, are you? What is this, Lost in Translation?",neutral,neutral,negative
"Thankfully I only stayed one night there and after arriving and waiting in line to check-in for almost 40 minutes, directions to our rooms were given to us. Directions that lead us to no results since we got lost. The layout of the casino and hotel is extremely confusing and is not intuitive at all. \n\nFinally we made it to our room and noticed a weird smell in the air. Not that of dead prostitute or cold tobacco thankfully, but it was rather funky and we had to crack the window open to freshen things up.\n\nThe room was decent but far from great. It was clean at least but the beds were a bit soft. The internet wasn't complimentary either and was something like $8 per device which I thought was rather expensive, especially in this day and age; at least it was fast.\n\nAlthough I'm sure that Circus Circus, at some point in time, might have been a nice play to stay at, it seems very beaten up and is now just a tacky, worn out and in dire need of rejuvenation kind-of-place. It's pretty bad in there and almost creepy. Looks like it hasn't been touched since the 70s or something and the casino floor is another great display of where I would not want to spend a dime. It smells bad and the croupiers are creepy looking.\n\nThere's a Krispy Kreme donut shop and a few shops on the lower floor and they have an entire part of the building that's under a giant, ugly purple down known as the \""Adventuredome\"" where there's some kind of theme park. It was closed when I tried to scout it out, possibly because it was past 10PM. It didn't look all that great.\n\nAs far as food options go, there's very little that they offer .There's a buffet but it looked terrible. We settled for Rock & Rita's for our breakfast and it was not all that great. There's a few bars but most of them are lame and past their prime as you'll be able to tell when walking around the place for over an hour around 10:30PM-ish.\n\nIn many ways, this place could be used a set for a sequel to Steven King's \""IT\"" movies or something. It's definitely creepy enough. Maybe they should just blow it up and build something else there. It might actually improve the value of the land and Circus Circus seems to be past it's prime... Way past it.\n\nI doub that I'd ever want to stay there again. There's many better options and most have a better location since Circus Circus is at the very beginning of the strip.",negative,neutral,neutral
"Been coming here since I was a kid. Stayed in the Skyrise Tower before and it was great no complaints. This time we got the chance to stay at the Circus Circus Manor Motor Lodge. Its was the chepest rates. So we said what the hell let's try it out. Arriving I thought, damn its gonna be real ghetto with all kinds of weird looking people. Wasn't to sure about it. Upon arriving we check in went to room and it kinda looks like appt complex. Seemed really quiet and sane normal looking people. When we went in room I checked everything from bathroom, to cabinets, to safe, to bed and under bed. Looking for any nasty s*** we didn't like or looked dirty. But hey it was actually pretty clean, no roaches and no bed bugs! The bed was very comfortable, better then I expected! The only down side is that its a walk to casino and the strip. But not too far. So wear some comfy shoes. I wouldn't mind staying here again if Skyrise Tower is all booked. So people try it out, its not as bad as some people make it seem. Cheapest rates, hey more money to gamble and drink...",positive,neutral,negative
"We came over to check out the adventuredome... Lol big laughs... Well it's off the strip, so it isn't as classy as everything else, the adventuredome is not bad, but rides are limited and somewhat costly IMO. There are some carnival games/arcade which I love so we played some... Other than that, we were bored and left back to the strip!",neutral,neutral,negative
"My wife and I stayed at Circus Circus for our honeymoon because my brother paid for our trip and was being price conscious.. not that there's anything bad about that and we definitely appreciate him hooking us up with a Vegas trip. We had alot of fun while we were there and was definitely worth it, but this is a review about Circus Circus so lets begin.\n\nThe place is definitely old and shows it. We got to the hotel and the minute we walked in the front door someone started trying to hook us up with complimentary shows and passes, but required a major credit card (if its complimentary, why do you need my credit card?)  We get to the check in area and there was nobody there. We waited about 20 minutes and finally someone showed up. Circus Circus charges a mandatory resort fee for each day you stay, and apparently from what I've read on other Hotel Reviews, pretty much all of them do... So we weren't surprised nor did we care to pay it.  After we got our room cards we proceeded to head to our rooms. We showed up on a Tuesday so there was hardly anyone around and that's understandable. We had to walk an ungodly distance to get to the tower our room was in.. The place really looked run down, everything was expensive and there were lots of kiosks everywhere selling useless junk at ridiculous prices. (i.e. Fake jewlery, hats and crap). Anyways, we got to our hotel room, and it was decent... about the equivalent of what you can expect from a Motel 6 or Super 8 as far as decor was concerned. Our view was overlooking the north end of the strip where you can see the Stratosphere and in the distance, downtown. The view was pretty nice if you ask me. The bed was extremely comfortable. The window to our room was partly open in the corner and was nailed in that way so we couldn't close it.\n\nThe food there was bland at best and I would recommend eating at other places. We enjoyed the free circus acts, its surprisingly entertaining. Come the weekend and all hell breaks loose... There are children EVERYWHERE bumping into you, screaming, acting like.. well... Children and we dare not try to go to the pool.\n\nThere were no attractions for 20-30 something adults, like clubs or anything like that. We would have to venture into the strip or downtown for that. The casino sections are amazingly boring and poorly lit.\n\nOverall, Im sure this place is great if you want to bring your kids to Las Vegas (why?... its Las Vegas.. should be adults only), but for grown ups, I recommend staying else where.  Other than that, it was an ok stay and we don't have anything else bad to say about this place.",neutral,negative,negative
"Review for casino only:\n\nI was at Circus Circus last night to go to their Steak House restaurant. I had forgotten how large the place is, but coming from the garage in the back, I didn't have to go to the main casino. I did anyway just to see one of the circus acts. Roller skating duos must be the rage in Las Vegas with a couple spinning there last night.\n\nThe place was cleaner than I remembered from years ago. It's not a place I'd go except for the restaurant, but it is OK.",neutral,neutral,positive
"This is my first time writing a review, and I did it because I had such a bad experience at this hotel.\n\nI got my stay here through another website i think it was hotels.com (not sure though) it was a good deal. 6 nights/7days king size bed with air conditioning and a fridge. Turned out it was at the manors not even connected to the hotel. I decided to upgrade when checking in. The lady was real nice about it and got us the upgrade real easy. Had to wait around about an hour or two because there card system was down.\n\nFrom first glance, the hotel looks grimy, old, and wore out. Same is said of the inside. It's stuffy everywhere and smells of smoke (which isn't to big of an issue for me)\n\n I went and got my key and went to pick up my luggage because I didn't want to carry it around with me, so I left it at the luggage hold area. No one was at the desk! and their were 4 other people waiting by the time I got there. 20 minutes passed before a lady showed up and started getting people their luggage. smallest quantity at a time. I had 5 so I had to wait until she got through all 4 other people. (she looked super annoyed with her job and looked like she didn't want to be here at all. no care about the customers/clients/guests)\n\nGet up to my room on 6th floor. My room is small with a small bathroom and a door to the adjacent room?? (Security risk any?) air conditioning didn't work, fan had mold on it, of course I didn't realize that until I started to get sick a day later from having it run. No fridge in my room like the deal said. Oh did I say I was put in a smoking room on a nonsmoking floor? because it was the only one available for upgrade. Well after a terrible night's rest, and getting sick from the mold they moved me down the hall to a new room.\n\nLooks Identical. only they gave me a fridge and a working air conditioner and no door to the adjacent room. Yet the room is placed in a similar location where my last room was, so whats up with that? the view from both rooms is terrible. You mostly look at a building in front of you and the roof of the main building area below you.\n\nThe Buffet Review: 1/5\n\nOver Priced, terrible selection of foods, and even worse in the taste department. After waiting in line for about 10 minutes which isn't to bad for lunch time. I got seated and went to look at the foods. Wide selection of choices they do have.\n\nMy first plate consisted of Mashed potatoes w/ gravy, fried chicken wings, mac & cheese, x2 sausage links, and toast. The wings, M&C, and potatoes were yucky. tasted like 3 day old KFC, because 2 day old KFC tastes better! The sausage links were cold in the center and under cooked, and the toast was just plain cold.\n\n2nd plate was a salad with olives, cheddar cheese, and ranch. Because the rest of the salad makings either don't belong on a salad or belong to a separate salad group. the dressings were miss labeled ( I don't think rang is supposed to be orange?) or they weren't labeled at all. The lettuce was dry and warm which salads aren't supposed to be warm. I also grabbed a plate of sliced cherry pie, my thought was how can you screw up pie?...Circus Circus did! it tasted like that fake pie you make when your to lazy to make your own or to cheap to buy the good stuff for an extra 2 bucks. Plus it was cold. If anything positive came out of the buffet it was the water. Because at least that they got right. Cold and wet!\n\nI'm almost done. Most of the people here are nice. The room keepers if your lucky enough to get English speakers are pretty nice. Unless they don't understand the word go away, or can't read the do not disturb sign. I was interrupted by several room cleaners on several occasions. They just barge right in without saying anything. I don't think they care to read the do not disturb sign clearly placed on the outside door handle. One of them came in while I was undressing ( which I wouldn't mind if she was attractive, which He wasn't) \n\nThe casino area. It clearly states no minors under the age of 21 allowed in or to loiter in the gaming area. I must have seen several kids sitting on the gambling games next to their parents which is illegal. I even saw a kid sitting at a black jack table, clearly under the age of 15. The waitress/servers in the casino area are not attractive but instead look like 40 year old ladies in terrible shape who shouldn't be wearing said outfits. Plus their service is terrible, they walk around saying \""drinks? Drinks\"" and they walk so fast you have to yell at them to get there attention. Then you don't see one for at least 20 minutes. cheaper to just sit at the bar. Plus I saw several of these servers just coughing on the drinks they were serving, made me sick knowing they coughed on people's drinks.\n\nOverall a bad stay here. Recommend if your looking for a cheap stay. better staying at a motel or something. Plus some health concerns here!",negative,neutral,positive
"I love having to purchase my own extension cords when outlets don't work.\n\nThe scenic view of exterior pipes is utterly breathtaking.\n\nI hate being treated well so I felt right at home.\n\nThanks for not providing a small fridge, microwave, or coffee maker as I love paying over $3 for a medium coffee and not being able to save this place's below average food.\n\nMy favorite feature of CC is still being charged an entire week when we decided to head home to finally relax.\n\nHighly recommended to anyone who finds camping to be luxurious.",negative,neutral,positive
"For $28, I'm not sure my expectations were ever very high. This is the kind of place where you can hear your neighbors having late-night sex (wait, that's probably just Vegas), the pillows smell like they haven't been thoroughly washed, and you see high-heeled girls getting into dark pimped-out cars at 6am. But it's cheap, and the kids love the Midway - we spent an entire afternoon playing the games there, helped out by $5 off each person's ticket that came with our hotel room. The gambling itself is OK, and we didn't try any of the food. It set us back about $15 each time we cabbed to either the main part of the strip or old town Vegas, so you have to factor that into your overall cost (it's a 3+ mile walk otherwise, in a not so great part of town). Would I come back? Well, it depends on what kind of vacation I wanted. For a total experience, probably a nicer hotel would be my choice, but if I want to optimize for spending my money gambling or shopping, I have no pride about staying in a place like this - why not? Just turn the pillow over - the other side is probably cleaner.",neutral,neutral,negative
