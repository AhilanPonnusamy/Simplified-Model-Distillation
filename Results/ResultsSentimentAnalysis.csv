"This Hotel is Great!!!  The employees that work here are all wonderful and friendly. The reason for the 1 star is for the RESORT FEE that has now gone up to $28 a night.\nI go to Las Vegas to gamble... I never use any of the so called amenities that this resort fee covers. (Spa, Gym, Pool, Wi-Fi , etc). So, why am I being forced to pay for something I don't use???",negative,neutral,negative
"Very disappointed customer. We spent the weekend here at harrahs And decided that after walking the strip we would see the show \""defending the cave man\"" which was a very funny show... Anyways, I decided that while being Vegas I did not want to show up to this show 30 min ahead of time as suggested , since the seats are ASSIGNED seating.... So I purchased the closest available seats which were around $50 a ticket. The back seats were $40. I paid the difference so I could show up exactly when the show starts and not have to worry about getting good seats... Remember it's ASSIGNED seating... Well guess what, we show up at 7 (starts at 7) and the lady sat us in the back ... So I go back outside and tell her that's not what I paid for. She states (these seats looked comfy for you two) and because my seats were already taken. After enjoying the show I complained to the box office who offered little help, only to refund me the difference of seats I was given... But to do that they had to refund me and charge me again.... (3 days to process) So now I'm down $100 while in Vegas. While In the room I called JOY the hotel manager who explained what they did was not right and would fix the situation.... Well she didn't... She said since my room was bought through American Express credit card they would not help us with any comps or refunds... Also the box office in harrahs hotel is not a part of the harrahs hotel as she stated so she cannot help me with this situation at all. She was nice enough to give me a food and beverage credit to the hotel... But guess what were leaving, so we can't use it... Thanks for nothing. In a jungle full of competitive hotel service, harrahs lost my business. \nAs for the rooms, clean.... But the pillows were hard and the beds were harder. Will not be visiting harrahs in the future.",negative,neutral,negative
"My husband and I have stayed at Harrahs a few times. This time we brought our kids and booked a \""classic\"" 2 queen bed room. This room is actually much quieter and bigger then their \""high roller\"" or \""premium\"" rooms, which is weird. There is no desk but there is a little table with 2 chairs. It's not fully updated but honestly it's not bad at all. I would book this room again if we had a choice of the other rooms. I didn't give 5 stars because the bathroom tub kept dripping water. It wasn't loud or anything but it was a minus.",positive,neutral,negative
"THIS HOTEL SUCKS. We decided to stay an extra night in Vegas and booked a room at the Harrahs because the Harrahs in Lake Tahoe is awesome. This place is the complete opposite. It took 30+ minutes to check in, ~20 minutes to valet and get our bags to the room. This place is extremely understaffed. The toilet didn't work when we finally got to the room and the cups were extremely dirty. Wouldn't stay here again. Ever. On top of that att signal barley works and the damn made came at 9 am knocking on the door. Cars in the parking lot get hit and broken into and all I heard were car alarms all night . This place needs major help. The room was $109 online but with service fees it ended up being $160. Stay somewhere else, anywhere else.",negative,neutral,negative
"This place is an absolute dump! I don't get how this place has so many good reviews!\n\nWe have been to Vegas a few times and decided to try Harrahs. We were told it wasn't fancy but clean...well that's not true! We were in the Mardi Gras tower. The 1st impression when we walked into out room was omg!!! I need to stay somewhere else! There was a heavy perfume smell as we walked in that was so powerful...next my eyes went straight to the bed where there was a big gross stain on the carpet...still I tried to relax and take it all in. There is adjoining doors to the room next to us which you can hear everything happening. To top it off a sticker saying at night please make sure to put the dead bolt on. There was an event on the Saturday and our room was $300 for the night...at that price I decided to complain. They were great about it and got us a new room.\n\nThe new room was still in Mardi Gras tower but had a small balcony and had no odor. The new room was way cleaner and the hallway leading to our room was brightly lit compared to previous room.\n\nThe only great thing about Harrahs is the location which is central to everything. \n\nThe smoke became overwhelming...most casino's have great ventilation. If you don't smoke I highly recommend you don't stay here!\n\nOK next is the spa...they had a pumpkin sugar pedicure for $60 that sounded nice. I went to the spa and they direct me to this little room with two pedicure chairs. This room is painted white with nothing in it. It was literally like a closet. Then as my pedicure is going on I notice the tools are in a dirty old make up box and the lady simply wiped off the tools and put them back in her kit. No disinfectant! I was disappointed and disgusted. The spa was the worst experience I have ever had in a spa.\n\nThey say they offer WiFi, it is so terrible if you need to use WiFi it Wil cost you! The free WiFi barely works.\n \nAfter our stay they refunded the incorrect amount for the deposit on our credit card after many phone calls we decided to cut our losses and forget the $27 they ripped off us. \n\nIn vegas there is so many awesome places to stay Harrahs is not one of them!",negative,neutral,negative
I booked here with a very good deal from expedia and it was on the LV strip. That's why I chose there. It wasn't that bad but if it wasn't on the strip I would look for somewhere else.,neutral,neutral,negative
"Are you grooming your child to become an over pampered trophy wife that has a penance for pink and rhinestones? You are? Well have I got the place for you! Kid's Kastle will ensure that your daughter expects to wear only $20 dollar fake rhinestone emblazoned headbands, $60 dollar tutus, or carry around her very own $100 dollar Hello Kitty suitcase. You can even buy her a set of press on nails that would make a Vegas stripper proud for around $15 bucks. I ensure you they will AT LEAST last until you make it out the Forum Shops!",negative,neutral,negative
UGH!! A Wolfgang Puck Chinese restaurant. Need I say more? I hate PF Chang's and any restaurant(s) resembling it. \n\nTake a good look at the clientele and you'll get an idea what sort of food you're about to eat.\n\nExpensive and not good. Why would anyone even consider eating here?,negative,neutral,negative
"Great food, great service, solid ambiance. We ordered the Valentines Day's wine menu special and it was just an overall fantastic experience. The attention from the wait staff was amazing for as busy as they were and for $125 per person including wine - 6 wines/6 mini-courses - what a great value! They even threw in a round of cocktails while we waited for our table.",positive,neutral,positive
"My boyfriend and I came here for one of his many birthday dinners in Vegas. \n\nWe did not have reservations so we sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks for about 15 minutes before our table was ready. The bar tender was quick to get us our drinks and was very attentive.\n\nWe were sat outside in the mall area. The boyfriend and I are major people watchers and I guess it was prom night for some local high school. We watched countless girls no older than 17 parade around looking like whores. Needless to say we had a good amount of laughs. \n\nThe bread basket was enough food that we didn't need to order appetizers. For two people, it was seriously bread overkill. What I did appreciate was UNSALTED butter offered with a side of coarse sea salt on the side. This is exactly what I do at home. I'm a butter snob and I refuse to touch salted butter unless there are no other available options.\n\nI ordered the spaghettini, which was delicious. Very simple, but done the from-scratch way, therefore perfection.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the half roasted chicken on mashed potatoes. His was very simple but also delicious. \n\nI love restaurants like Spago, that offer some really classic and simple dishes but made with high quality ingredients with very high standards. The potions were large as well and well priced. There are other things on the menu I'd like to try, so I suppose on my next Vegas trip I'll be stopping in again.",positive,neutral,negative
Spent 2 Nites right @ the Bar at my favorite Vegas joint. Spago is what makes Vegas Special. Great appetizers. Wonderful drink concoctions by 2 Spirir Pros: Tony & Peter. We had a blast here each nite\n\nWe'll be back....like we always do.,positive,neutral,positive
"Came Thanksgiving weekend to watch the Sting concert at the Colosseum. After the concert, we decided to grab a bite at Spago's. Surprisingly, we only ordered two entrees (Those who know me well, know that I usually go ALL out and order a few appetizers, entrees, and desserts. My eyes are ALWAYS bigger than my stomach!). \n\nThe bolognese pasta with fresh ricotta cheese was oh-so yummy. I usually don't order meat sauces because I can make that stuff anytime at home...However, I'm glad I ordered this entree, which was cooked al dente and the amount of sauce didn't overpower the pasta itself. The portion was reasonable too.\n\nThe fairly thin-crusted prosciutto pizza with baby arugula was yummy too! The prosciutto tasted fresh and not dried out. Only request I have is if there was more prosciutto on the pizza!!! LOVE, LOVE prosciutto!\n\nThe complimentary bread and crackers were delish too...the onion bread was good to dip into my pasta dish.\n\nThese two entrees including tax came out to exactly $40. \n\nWill come again!",positive,neutral,negative
"5 Stars for the Food! 1 Star for our server which was horrible!\n\nMy girlfriend and I have dined with Spago's a few times and every time we leave the restaurant satisfied. However this past weekend we met one of the worse wattress in fine dining. Her name was Keren. A few points about Keren\n\n1. Rushed us to order\n2. Never smiled \n3. Checked on us only once during the meal\n4. Everyone in the restaurant received their amuse bouche except us (our bill even listed it came with the meal but we never received it)\n5. Our food took a long time and she never once came by during the time we waited to reassure us it was coming out or was apologetic.\n6. No smile, I didn't feel welcomed\n\n\nOn to the food. We ordered the braised short ribs and the veal. The short ribs were excellent, came with knocchi on the bottom, very well portions. With the veal, I would skip it. Maybe I'm not a veal eater but it reminds me of pork chops. Overall, I think the wattress really left a bad taste in my mouth so my appetite was not well.",negative,neutral,negative
"Nice casual atmosphere....\n\nHowever the food was underwhelming to say the least.  If I was eating in a airport cafe or a 3 star hotel lobby, the food would be decent.  It was plain boring and lacked any intensity.\n\nService....Bleah!\n\nSerious WP, do you just want to say you have a bunch of restaurants in Vegas or do you really care what your restaurants are actually serving?  I get it. Tourist trap, lots of foot traffic....easy money. Yeah you don't care.",negative,neutral,negative
"I enjoyed my meal at Spago, but wasn't as impressed as my companions. The wedge salad is good but not notable, however the heirloom tomato and burrata salad special was outstanding - the best overall dish of the night. \n\nWe ended up splitting 3 pizzas - I have to say, I found the crust to be disappointing on all of them. Not much flavor at all - more of just a vehicle for the toppings. As for the specific pies:\n-Margherita - crust was a bit undercooked, and overall I would call this a pretty average Margherita pizza\n-Proscuitto - this was the best of the 3 - the Proscuitto and Fromage blanc worked perfectly together. With a great crust this pizza would have mind blowing potential.\n-Lamb Chorizo - a very nice pie overall - enjoyed the chorizo, and the toppings all worked well together. \n\nService was excellent.",positive,neutral,positive
"Spectacular food and service. We started with the blue shrimp salad which was prepared with an orange sauce - out of this world! My wife had the veal and I had the ahi tuna, both were marvelously presented and tasted phenomenal. Eat bite was savored. We pair our meals with the four vine Chardonnay (meat), and the Pinot noir (fish). Great choices. For dessert we had the apple crumble prepared in a bourbon sauce. That was the only part of the meal we would only give four stars. Everything else was five star.\n\nThe one drawback was the overwhelming noisy atmosphere. Might be their design intention though. We would recommend!",positive,neutral,negative
"In my 8 years living in Las Vegas, I never had a chance to try Spago. I view it as a bit out of price range, so when their 20 Year Anniversary came up with roll-back pricing, I had to try it. Went last night with my date, and we asked the assistant GM Drew to pick our food. Here's what he picked, and my thoughts on each:\n\nSignature Roasted Beet Goat Cheese Salad\nI never would have ordered this but it was delicious.\n\nHouse Smoked Sturgeon, Crisp Potato Galette, Horseradish Cream - $12\nIt was like a spicy latke with fish on top. Really good.\n\n\n\""Chinois Style\"" Colorado Lamb Chops, Cilantro Mint Vinaigrette, Sweet & Sour Eggplant - $33\nTender and delicious even without the sauce. Eggplant was so good my date and I couldn't figure out if it was eggplant!\n\nCantonese Style Roasted Duck with Wild Huckleberries, Ginger and Stir-Fried Baby Bok Choy - $20\nHuge and delicious, and unexpected as we thought we were only getting 1 main course to share. Needless to say we had plenty of leftovers.\n\nEven with the discount I spent a bit more than I had hoped, but everything was delicious and the service was great, as well. Oh, and they have an amazing bread platter. Wish I was hungrier and got to try more of that!\n\nThanks, Drew W & Scott G!",positive,neutral,negative
"Came here with hubs and the inlaws. OMG. Everything was amazing and everyone loved their food! Service was awesome and the chef even came by to check on us.\n\nWild mushroom risotto...mmmmmmmm!!!! My lamb chops were killer. Even the sun dried tomatoes were tasty and fresh. Hubs got the duck breast....ohhhh...myyyyy.....GAWD! My father-in-law's New York steak, even though he likes med well and I'm a med rare person, was still delicious. Mom-in-law got some fish dish, and I don't eat seafood but her plate was empty, so she obviously loved it. We shared the chocolate layer cake dessert which came with some salted caramel gelato...yum!\n\nWe were hurtin' so good afterward! This place is a must on our next trip to Vegas. One of the best dinners ever!!!",positive,neutral,negative
"Food was OK, but service was awesome! Our original group of 10 ballooned to a group of 20, and they didn't blink an eye and accommodated our group's last minute changes.",positive,neutral,positive
"Bah, a better word for this place would be \""SALT.\""\n\nFrom the salt covered butter that's served with the bread, to the salt drenched salad, arriving at the salty, uninspiring pepperoni pizza, all I could taste was salt. \n\nIt gets two stars simply for the servers, who were awesome and kind people. At least the water they provided was salt-less and helped re-hydrate me.",negative,neutral,positive
"You can't really go wrong at Spago. The staff was superb and the food was really good. I was totally bummed that the Wedge Salad was taken off the menu - it was one of my very favorites that I look forward to every time I'm in Vegas. Of course, the price was just a hair high for my comfort zone, but it was good nonetheless.",positive,neutral,positive
See my other Yelp under Forum Shops!\n\nBut DAMN - I love this store and the Forum Shops. Wonderful experiences.,positive,neutral,positive
"The customer service here is horrible. As most of the reviews say, I was not greeted and had to ask for help even though it was not a busy night. I wanted to get my make-up done and the lady told me very rudely I had to make an appointment and she did not offer me to wait as a walk in. My second time around I called to make an appointment. The lady who answered the phone told me she was going to put me on hold for a \""minute.\"" I was put on hold for exactly 18 minutes and 45 seconds only to be told they were all booked for tomorrow. I know this location stays open because of the location but they represent MAC as a company very poorly.",negative,neutral,negative
"i dont know if im super spoiled from eating in san francisco all the time or what. but i thought this place was terrible. as soon as i got in, you could definitely sense some attitude from the servers. if the food is good, i really wouldn't mind or care. i ordered the scallop special as a starter and got a sweet potato tortelloni with shortribs from their tasting menu. was also able to try stuff off their regular menu such as the pork, veal, salmon and desserts. the food was very underwhelming. i usually spare no expense when it comes to food, and pay very little attention to my bills usually. but this place was just ridiculous. it was marked up because of its vegas location. even without the markups, the food would have been nowhere near worth the price. \n\nthe flavors were very bland and did not contrast well as i would expect fine foods to. there was nothing surprising about the flavors out of every dish i tried. actually, there were even parts of my pasta that were not fully cooked. im a huge fan of the al dente, but hard pasta is not good in my opinion. maybe i went on an off night. food aside, having the staff trying to push every little charge on you isnt my idea of a nice experience.\n\nin addition, my friend asked for sorbet for dessert. they gave her 2 or 3 scoops of fruit sorbet for $16.....i don't know about that.",negative,neutral,positive
"There seems to be only one listing for this place here on Yelp, but to be accurate (as some others have noted) there are two places, the fancier and pricier Valentino and the more casual and cheaper Grill @ Valentino, we were considering taking in the fine dining option, but after viewing the menu, we just weren't feeling anything, so we went with the grill.\n\nService was a bit spotty, our waiter brought our water and immediately asked about our wine selection, before we had gotten a chance to view the list. Then, after bringing us our appetizer and salad course, was nowhere to be found when we wanted to order entrees. \n\nThe food, however, was very good. This place boasts one the best alfredo sauces I've had on the strip, and while it's not a particularly fancy option, it's something that many places don't do that well. Caesar salad was crisp and light and everything was generally what you'd expect from a casual italian place",positive,neutral,negative
"There is nothing wrong with this place. But there is nothing extraordinary either. To be quite honest, I dined there with my mom, because we had a 20% coupon. Why not?\n\nThe service was great; we had a couple of waiters, and for having to work during the holidays (I went during Christmas time), they were upbeat and knowledgeable.\n\nThe food, on the other hand, was nothing amazing. I got a side of roasted vegetables drizzled with Balsamic Vinegar, and it was fine. I also had a special ravioli of the day, which had an interesting flavor, but the texture was a bit on the chewier side. It did taste nice, but I was not overly impressed.\n\nOverall, nothing was too spectacular about this place, but it tasted fine. It is a little on the pricier side for the quality of food you get, but we had a coupon, so I wasn't too bummed about that!",neutral,neutral,positive
"The food was ok, ordered couple of appetizers, dinner and wine was thinking it was going to be great, but I was not impressed at all! Place was nice and clean, Server was nice..\nI don't think I would ever come back here, but I can atlest say I tried it .",negative,neutral,positive
"Very clean flavors. The tuna was seared to perfection. It was subtly seasoned and had really great flavors. What I didn't like was the slaw. It was mediocre at best. The shortribs with chipotle mash was yummy!!! Thought it was something I can make at home myself, the tuna, on the otherhand, I couldn't. \n\nThis was a great option when you want something casually nice but don't want to walk too far (if you're in the Central Strip).",positive,neutral,positive
"Great mexican fare, absolutely tasty and well executed. Great for lunch, not sure I would have dinner there, in the Canal Shoppes mall, unless you really want to see and hear the gondoliers on and on. A bit pricey for classic mexican food, no matter how good, so rating is set at 3.",neutral,neutral,positive
"Came to Vegas for SHOT show and subsequently never left the Venetian. Taqueria Canonita, you would think being so close to the border and with so many people coming from LA to Vegas, they would have some great Mexican food. I ordered the Santa Rosa Pork Barbacoa at the recommendation of the waiter. As my stomach churned for that slow cooked, delicious pork, I was greeted with a fairly bland and very dry pork. I would have been better off with Chipotle's barbacoa than what Canonita served up. The empanadas that were ordered for the table were far from crispy and the guacamole that came with the tortilla chips were not fully mashed. Far too many errors for a sit down restaurant to be any good. On the plus side, the tequila helped me forget the awful food.",negative,neutral,negative
"Hungry and craving Mexican food in the Venetian? This is a pretty good place to go. The portions are big and the restaurant itself is nice. It is right next to the canal so you can wave at the gondolas going by. \n\nI agree with the other guy. The food was solid. We ordered the carne asada tacos which came with 3 tacos and a side of rice and beans. It was good, but we weren't raving over it. THE POSOLE THOUGH. It was my first time having Posole (I was surprised it was green) and it was really tasty. My friend knows her food and she loved it as well. We kept wanting to go back for more Posole, but didn't have the chance to.",positive,neutral,positive
This is a decent Mexican restaurant with great staff and a relaxed environment. We had some wonderful beef enchiladas and a nice dining exerience.,positive,neutral,positive
"Just came to pass the time with a drink. Nice location on the grand canal inside the Venetian, great ambience. \n\nThe margarita, advertised as \""the best in town\"", was definitely not, but for $5 at happy hour, was a good value. \n\nChips were standard out of a bag probably, but the salsa was good with some roasted pepper in there.\n\nUPDATE: Despite not being a featured happy hour drink, I ordered the jalape\u00f1o-infused margarita. MUCH better, the ingredients seem fresher (the Classic was too syrupy). The jalape\u00f1o-infused has fresh orange and cilantro in it for an interesting twist.",positive,neutral,negative
"This place is located in the Venetian and has great tacos, burritos and enchiladas. The service is always good and I frequently take colleagues here. My favorite appetizer is the chips, salsa and guacamole and the drinks are delicious as well! The prices are a bit high but I get a corporate discount which is nice. Would recommend for a nice Mexican food night out!",positive,neutral,positive
"The goods: chips and guacamole, ca\u00f1onita margarita, mojitos, and... Um....\n\nThis place is great for resting your feet and chomping some chips to absorb the remainder of last night's alcohol. Having a margarita will chase that last shadow of a hangover away. Just don't expect to be in a hurry or to be at all dazzled by the food.\n\nAn hour into our meal, our dishes arrived and were flavorless and UNCOOKED. Plates seemed like they weren't clean and service was excruciatingly slow. As many other reviews state, this isn't a place to enjoy much of anything other than drinks. As it to your Las Vegas Don't Do List.",negative,neutral,negative
"Ok, I am a lookie look shopper, not someone that actually buys this ridiculously expensive stuff.  The place is done up nice, and is fairly new. St. Marks square reproduction starts your journey. All kinds and types of shops. \n\nThe Venetian glass shop was my favorite. So, take a stroll and check it out. The shoppes have something for everybody.",positive,neutral,positive
"You'd expect a better range of stores located here but you won't find it. We were fighting the crowds and all we found were the usual stuff like Kenneth Cole, Ann Taylor, BCBG -- nothing out of the ordinary. On top of that you'll be trying to fight through the people standing around watching tourists go on a gondola ride.\n\nParking sucks too because the Venetian is such a popular hotel that their valet parking fills up rather quickly and then it becomes available for hotel guests only. You'll have to make your way to the self parking which is a horrendous 10-floor structure. Once you've parked, you'll have to maneuver your way to the elevators where you will be fighting more people to finally get to the shopping area. The worse part is getting back to your car because there will be a line waiting to get into the elevators.\n\nHorrible horrible place to shop. Go to the Forum Shops instead.",negative,neutral,negative
"Oh The Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes. I have brought many a family member and friend here just to walk around and gawk at things. I have never, not once, bought something here. I am sure other locals will not be surprised by this omission, as I am sure other locals would say the same thing.\n\nThe gondola rides have been around forever it seems and I have yet to step foot on one. However, it is fun to giggle at the tourists floating around in a fake Venice. I suppose if I had the expendable cash it would be a cute thing to do, but considering how long I've gone without doing the gondola ride, my expectations of really doing it are very low.\n\nI feel as though the Canal Shoppes are set up strangely and I always get lost. I've been in this place probably 20+ times and I still get lost. Especially now that they have been linked to the Palazzo Shoppes. \n\nPlus, I am sorry, but I just cannot get over the baby-hooker smell of The Venetian/Grand Canal Shoppes. Yes, I have dubbed it baby-hooker smell. I don't care what The Venetian thinks it smells like, it smells like baby-hooker.",negative,neutral,neutral
This is a great way to avoid the 100+ degree temps. The shops are high end but bargains can be had if you look around. The restaurants are of good quality with none any better or worse than the other.,positive,neutral,positive
"Maybe we just went on a bad day last December when everything was closing early due to snow. However, they had some cool games but it would have been crazy to pay for a full day when we could only play for two hours. \n\nThe bathrooms were disgusting and the entire place smelled of raw sewage. I felt like I was in the French Quarter in New Orleans!",negative,neutral,negative
"An easy little stroll from Excalibur, MGM, New York New York and a few other hotels on the strip. They have literally EVERYTHING. \n\nGreat place to do some room stocking when a simple soda or bottle of water is 3 bucks and up in the casino. I wandered down to grab some beverages and snacks for the stay and was back to my room in no time. \n\nNice to know there's somewhere you can grab a few things you may have forgotten or didn't think you needed.",positive,neutral,positive

Love this place!! Very friendly staff! Huge selection of guns! Great rental counter and don't forget the awesome selection of full autos and semi autos to rent and shoot!!! Love it! We had a blast! Literally! :) thanks Discount Firearms!! Defiantly recommend this place! Especially the gm he came out just to make sure we had a great time!,positive,neutral,positive
"A friend of mine had recommended checking this place out due to the prices being fair and usually lower than all the competitors. I had also heard that they did consignment and decided that the old W.W. Greener that I had could possibly find a new home through them. \n\nAfter walking in I noticed that it has a different feel than most gun shops in town. All of the other shops I have been in have the concrete grey floors and the very minimalist/Bunkeresque feel to them. It seemed to me like they try to make this place feel a little more inviting, it could just be that the place had wood floors and and a different feel when they leased the place but it works. \n\nI presented my shotgun to the clerk on duty and he was very knowledgeable and friendly when it came to researching the gun and giving me a strait forward answer. He had mentioned that He could put it on the shelves but due to where we live and what people want that unless it is an assault rifle that looks like the ones in the video games it will probably sit for quite some time but he would recommend listing it myself on Gun Broker and sure enough I did and it sold.\n\nA took a few minutes to chat with the guy before walking around and checking out accessories, which I must add, they were definitely not cheaper than other shops when it came to those. I priced a Black Hawk Paddle holster and it was insanely marked up but the guns seem to be okay. \n\nI would go back here if I needed to consign something or get some quick gun advice but no necessarily for accessories or ammo",positive,neutral,negative
"I haven't been here in quite some time due to the fact that it used to have a pretty crappy reputation for bad customer service, but I recently came to give it another shot since they were bought out about 2+ years ago and wanted to see what the race was all about. I see them all over facebook and on the radio. Needless to say I walked away very impressed! They gave the store a complete make over! It looks great and feels better! The staff was very nice and helpful. Their was some of the same staff there but they had a much better attitude than they used to.\n  They even came out from behind the counter to help me find a holster for my Sig 238. They also carry a lot of new product! Before it was kinda empty and pathetic other than magazines etc. now they are a full 5.11 dealer!!!! I love 5.11! They have the pants the shirtstge bags,(range and rifle cases) even they backpacks! They even have the holsters, attachment for the packs, socks, boots, even the briefs and undershirts! Their selection of guns was great!! Especially in the gun economy where everything is hard to get. Can you tell I was shocked!! Lol \nAnyways. If you haven't been in for a while or not at all, definitely worth the trip!! I am glad I did! I will be back for sure! The General Manager even came out to make sure I was being taken care of! Oh yeah I got a new backpack while I was their! The 5.11 rush 24! I travel a lot and love a comfy durable pack! See you soon Discount!!",positive,neutral,positive
Both times I have been in here I have been disappointed. Last time when I was look for a firearm they showed me a little pink gun I'm assuming because I'm a female. This time we came because online it states they are a full 5.11 retailer. They are not as we were only able to locate 1 polo that was 5.11. It is now the beginning of June and they still have a 2day sale sign up for 20% off 5.11 that is from May. Also because we were not looking at the firearms not a single employee spoke to us. I will continue to stay away from this store as they are not customer friendly.,negative,neutral,negative
"We did the 10 minute flight over the strip, the tour van picked us up in the secret Venetian parking lot in the rear where no one can see whats really going on. I had to squeeze in the back of this grimey van next to some odd couple it was the only place I could fit, luckily I am small otherwise who knows how this would have worked! My partner in crime rode shotgun rather than attempt fitting anywhere else in the dirty sardine packed van. They drive you to their office. The whole way I am texting my b/f my last will and testament, just in case! You get there and are told you will weigh in yay! You get some all you can drink cheap champagne in those fancy plastic cups ;) as you painfully wait to watch a safety video that basically sells their DVD's. Then you wait to get on another van that takes you to the actual airport. They pair you with 4 other people or 2 couples however way you want to look at it but it is done by weight. The pilot had the tour down he was very knowledgeable about the strip etc. I suggest not using your flash if the pilot says \""ahhh Go ahead\"" I was dissapointed in the $35 video they get you waving before flight then again after landing its not even real sound and the dvd itself is just another advertisement I will probably never share with family or friends. You get what you pay for maybe?!?! Next time I will check yelp first I promise!",negative,neutral,negative
"I cannot believe ANYONE was able to give this company a good review! I am by far completely and utterly dissatisfied with their morals and values. I am also completely dissatisfied with their service and integrity. From the reviews on trip advisor I'm sure that whatever misfortune they have experienced they definitely deserved.\n\nI've never heard of the company until I purchased a deal on Living Social. Needless to say I've never been on a helicopter and was extremely excited to experience this. Upon receiving my deal I immediately made a phone call to the company to make my appointment. I called them on a Saturday and ended up scheduling for a Tuesday. The phone call wasn't all that pleasant but it wasn't bad either. That is literally three days in between. We show up for our appointment 10 minutes early and the doors are locked, lights on, the place is a mess and looks to have been cleared out and left in a hurry. We circled the parking lot looking for an agent, we tried calling several times with a busy tone every time, and everyone we asked had no idea where the Heli USA workers were at. We finally got help from a very nice lady in the Aviation building who told us that several other individuals had come through there asking the same questions we were and it seems the company had just vanished. Good thing I paid my money to Living Social, otherwise I'm sure I would have completely lost out on getting a refund.\n\nWhat makes me more upset is that on a Saturday this woman did not have the decency of a human being to let us know that things with the company are not going well, or even to give us a heads up and say wait until Monday to make an appointment. The shadiness of it all truly was unprofessional, disappointing, and most of all annoying. I hope anyone that has purchased the Living Social deal reads this first. BEWARE!!\n\nUGH, It wouldn't let me give 0 stars. So one because I have to.",negative,neutral,negative
"I'm not a big sports fan. In fact, I'm not a sports fan (I watch for cheerleaders, car crashes when my wife isn't around). We had a group dinner here, but our reservations got messed up and our group of 13 was going to be put at two separate tables. After some protracted negotiation, we were put in a small glassed off room.\n\nFrom then on, it was a good experience. The food menu was largely burgers (and some of the best buffalo wings I have had in a long time) and large beers (24 ouncers).\n\nAfterwards, we headed upstairs to the gaming zone, an area with sports-ish video games. It was a little weird playing video games iwth co-workers, but we had a blast on the different driving games.\n\nIf sports on TV is your thing, this is your place. Otherwise, its just another okay restaurant with lots of TVs on the multiple ESPN stations.",neutral,neutral,negative
It was good........we were all hungry after hanging at the pool all day so we wanted a quick bite to eat.....\n\nthe nachos came out fast but the rest took a little while.\n\nI had the chicken tenders salad which made me wonder why didn't i just order the chicken tenders ha!\n\nAt least the boys had a good view of the TV :),neutral,negative,positive
"I was in heaven!!!!!!!\n\nI kid you not, it felt like I shed a tear when I walked in. There was over 100 TV's all around the restaurant. There wasn't a seat where you couldn't see a game. \n\nThe menu is not the greatest in the world, but it's a sports bar, there shouldn't be much to ask but burgers, wings and beer. You shouldn't ask for more than that. Their portions are decent size.\n\nBeware of the Nachos cause even though they say they are appetizers on the menu, they are bigger than your head. I can't wait to go back there and watch a Raider game....yes you heard me right a Raider game.",positive,neutral,positive
"ESPN Zone has cool concept. Eat while watching your favorite sports teams. We came here last week to watch the Warriors game. My cousin's 4 year old son Loves the warriors. He can sit through a whole game and knows most of the players. I think its pretty amazing. So after leaving him in this kids place most of the day we thought he would enjoy ESPN Zone for dinner. \n\nThe food was actually not bad. But nothing spectacular. I usually list everything off but I'm not going to b/c that's all you really need to know. It's bar food. \n\nThe service actually is not good. The waiter even gave my mother attitude when she asked him about a drink. He might not have heard her b/c the place is loud but attitude was not necessary. \n\nThe TV at the table was pretty cool. They have all these different feeds and you can chose what you want to watch. We were however having some volume issues. All we could hear was the booth's next to us feed. And yes, I did try to raise the volume using the touch pad tv screen. It wasn't working.",neutral,neutral,negative
"Why did I even come here, this is a big ass tourist trap to begin with and I knew it, I have been to the one in Time's Square for Peet's sake, the beer were expensive, I had the wings and it was barely tolerable as it didn't really have a real flavor to them. The only decent things were the service, the big screen TVs with sports on them (this is ESPN Zone after all) and free wi-fi, so supposedly you can do work. Just skip this place there are far better places to enjoy a game while in Vegas.",negative,neutral,negative
In search of something decent in the hot evening as we pass through casino after casino with the Saturday night hooch in full watch.\nWe make it over to ESPN in New York.\nOne thing you know about here is it will be consistent and they got Stella on top..\nYes... my dirty Belgium blonde\nThe black n blue burger with the apple walnut salad.\nLike i said it worked!\nAdd a 32oz beer n the night is good to go.,positive,neutral,positive
"I've eaten here several times and USUALLY have a great experience. However, the last two times I've visited the ESPN Zone, the service hasn't been that great and the food is on a downward trend. During my last visit, the nachos we ordered came out barely warm...as if they had been sitting for a few minutes. Then the burger I had, tasted like cheap beef. I have eaten a burger here before and I know this was not their normal quality. Ironically, while I was staying in Vegas, the news reported that Disney will be closing several ESPN Zone restaurants, including the one in Vegas. If you want to eat a sports bar with lots of tvs, go to Iggy's.",negative,neutral,negative
"The location is pretty decent and you don't have to deal with any casinos or smoke. the morning breakfast is very good and the suites are clean and well-appointed. the breakfast has waffles, eggs, potatoes, juices, yogurt, etc. and will fill you up.\n\n the only complaint is that they keep trying to push the travel club on you. they leave messages on your phone (it woke me up at 8AM on Saturday morning!) and push it on you if you ask them any questions.",positive,neutral,negative
"Overall everything here was OK. The hotel needs to be renovated, I think the staff does a good job with working with what they have, but the rooms themselves feel a little rundown, the furniture is worn etc...\n\nThe room at least felt clean and the location is great. It is within walking distance to the strip, but not on it, yet they have plenty of stuff to eat literally right outside the parking lot. \n\nThe staff here was friendly and everything else was good.",neutral,neutral,positive
Very good Asian Fusion cuisine. I've been there three times and never had anything that wasn't very good. The garlic crab is wonderful and the salt and pepper calamari is good but be ready for SALT and PEPPER. The atmosphere is very nice with a live jazz group playing background music. It's a great place for a romantic dinner or to hang out with friends. Not terrific for kids and I have no idea about parking - I usually take a cab.,positive,neutral,positive
"I'm a native San Franciscan, so of course I've been to Crustacean and Thanh Long in San Francisco. Both restaurants are to die for, but this location's food is nothing like either one. I went to Vegas about 3 years ago for a friend's birthday, so of course we had to check out the place. We ordered the garlic crab and the garlic noodles. The waiter brought out to us a crab shell stuffed with crab meat and it tasted nothing like either of their places back in the City. I was floored! There's nothing like craking your own crab. Plus it was a tad bit more expensive. The location was nice, though. We decided to order a bottle of wine and just made the best out of the evening.",negative,neutral,negative
"This is the main store, but it's also in a few strip clubs around town including my club (rhino) good selection of clothes, shoes, and jewelry. Sadly, I wish some of the people were friendlier.

"Worst Apple Store Ever. (If you're an American)\n\nThis is a store that is frequently visited by Las Vegas foreign tourists. I'm not slamming anyone for pointing that out, but it is a major factor in why this is such a different store than the rest. The employees simply don't care or try. You walk in and there is NOBODY that will greet you, and thats because they know they'll make their sales regardless of their efforts. The \""tourists\"" are going to buy no matter what and they know it so the employee (and management) effort is minimal.",negative,negative,negative
"This was the first store we hit when we got to Fashion Show Mall.\n\nWe dont have a Hot Topic in Canada. I always enjoy going to stores we don't have.\n\nThis location wasn't overly big. Mostly Tshirts, cheap jewelry and \""Mall GothFashion\""\n\nI wasn't in the mood to try any clothes on or I would of checked out a few skirts I saw.\n\nWe only bought a few cosmetic items, bright blue & green liquid eyeliner, and a white eyeshadow. They were all on clearance which is funny since I only use high end cosmetics. But I had forgot some of my makeup at home, and brightly colored liquid liner is sometimes hard to find.\n\nThe girl who rang us up had super cool nails. She wasnt overly friendly but did tell us how the salon did the tips all glittery.\n\nI now kinda wish I would of tried that skirt on ... Hmmm another reason to return to Vegas sooner, then later.",positive,neutral,negative
"Gorgeous store. Large and bright and wonderfully layed out. This store has everything coach all under one roof. I would say this is the nicest one I've ever been to. This includes shoes, travel luggage, jewelry and much, much more! I love seeing the new stuff which hopefully makes it to the outlet stores soon. I also appreciate sales folks that leave you alone to browse. I'm liking the new sequin purses for this season. Also some very awesome shoes, Coach is definitely on the up and up!",positive,neutral,positive
"For the kitsch factor, for something to do for a day, this place is fine. It's got games and the carousel bar and cheesy circus acts. But it's dirty, it's run down, it's poorly planned, and I wouldn't stay here if my life depended on it. (OK, MAYBE then.) I tell people who come to visit all the time to not be taken in by the cheap rates here and at the Tropicana. There's a reason WHY they're cheap.",negative,neutral,negative

"I knew what I was getting into when I booked reservations at this hotel so I can't really say I was surprised at the experience. I was expecting dumpy, run down, lots of kids and probably not that great of service and that's basically what we got. \n\nWhy'd I still go ahead and book my reservation? Frightdome. Frightdome was one of the big reasons we came to Vegas on this trip. So we figured \""Might as well book a room in the same hotel that Frightdome will be in so we can just crawl back to our rooms when all is said and done.\"" and that's basically what we did. \n\nWe booked a room for Saturday night. Arrived a couple of hours before Frightdome was set to open, dropped our bags off in the room and actually rested a bit. To be honest...the rooms were actually pretty decent and the walls must have been super thick because I never heard anyone in the hallway or in the rooms around us the entire time. \n\nThe hotel/casino itself like I stated before is rundown and just not a pleasant experience. But on the upside it was a 10 minute walk from our room to Frightdome. Check in was a nightmare. They only had two people checking people in. We got in about a 20 person line and by the time we got up to the desk the line had doubled. When I commented about the lack of staff the person checking us in said that the hotel had made lots of cuts. Wonderful. \n\nOh, well. We had a decent night's sleep and got the hell out of dodge come 8am.",neutral,neutral,negative
"Drink service deplorable.  Tacky, tacky deco, if you can even call it that.  Its cheap, convenient to the strip. That's about all I can say. Hotel rooms dated and some are worn, tho not thread bare. Average to slightly below average. Kids EVERYWHERE underfoot. NOT a fave of mine. I give it the second star for the occasional decent free circus acts.",negative,neutral,negative
"Ehh... maybe it is because I have low standards, and that I have lived a lifestyle in which the toilet was literally a hole in the ground for me to pee on, but I did not have much of a problem with staying here. There are honestly superior hotels in the strip, but if you've lived in a straw hut like I did you'd at least be thankful that your stuff will be safe whilst you enjoy Vegas.\n\nYou're not visiting Vegas to sulk in a pretty hotel, are you? What is this, Lost in Translation?",neutral,neutral,negative
"For the prices we paid to stay here two nights, (over $200 total) I expected a nice room with a fair view. When I ordered the tower king rooms, I did NOT expect to only be on the fifth floor and only get to see the very top of the below building. Nor did I expect them to place us in an area undergoing construction! We should have at least gotten a discount for putting up with that!\n\nPlus, when we checked in, there was a HUGE line that took forever to get through. \n\nOur room amenities were limited to a very small bottle of lotion, a miniscule amount of shampoo+conditioner in one, and one lego-sized cube of soap. The alarm on the clock didn't work, and there were chips of paint missing all over the toilet seat. Plus, the bath drain would get clogged and fill up during a shower. \n\nThe hotel itself had tons of entertainment opportunities, such as the adventuredome, casino, arcade, carnival-area, and pool. \nBut the staff in the carnival area were rude, and one even told us we weren't allowed to sit in the lounge chairs. Like, wtf?!? Then what are the effing chairs for?!?\nFurthermore, the pool is only open from 9 AM to 5 PM, so you can't use the hot tub at night. We were tempted to sneak into another hotel's pool area because we missed the cutoff - but we didn't.\nAlso, you have to pay for internet here, which is the pits. I can deal with 2 or even 5 dollars a day, but it's $11-something here! That's ridiculous! I brought my laptop, but we didn't end up using it at all because of that insane price.\n\nThe hotel will advertise that it's on a prime part of the strip, but actually it's on the very South edge. Non-in-shape people, like myself, will probably have to pay for other modes of transportation to get to the REAL prime points farther down the strip.\n\nOn the good side, our bathroom was pretty large, and the hair dryer actually worked. \nAlso, the buffet here is rockin', in my opinion. And I love love love the crazy decorations and lights surrounding the outside.\nThere's also a free, but very minimal, circus show that starts at 11 AM everyday. However, from what I could tell, it was only a few acrobat routines and that was it.\nOn the morning we checked out, there was this really funny clown paid to pretend to be really sleepy in the lobby. I posted a couple pictures - I thought that was a riot. Definitely a great comedic addition.\n\nAnyway, I could have paid a quarter of the price at that gross Travel Suites neighboring Circus Circus, and not have gotten even half the hassles we had to deal with here. I also heard Luxor had been doing a $70 dollars a night deal, which I should have gone for considering they're so much more elegant of a hotel.\n\nWell, I lived and learned. Circus Circus is not worth it. Though I know it could have been a lot worse.",negative,neutral,negative

"Thankfully I only stayed one night there and after arriving and waiting in line to check-in for almost 40 minutes, directions to our rooms were given to us. Directions that lead us to no results since we got lost. The layout of the casino and hotel is extremely confusing and is not intuitive at all. \n\nFinally we made it to our room and noticed a weird smell in the air. Not that of dead prostitute or cold tobacco thankfully, but it was rather funky and we had to crack the window open to freshen things up.\n\nThe room was decent but far from great. It was clean at least but the beds were a bit soft. The internet wasn't complimentary either and was something like $8 per device which I thought was rather expensive, especially in this day and age; at least it was fast.\n\nAlthough I'm sure that Circus Circus, at some point in time, might have been a nice play to stay at, it seems very beaten up and is now just a tacky, worn out and in dire need of rejuvenation kind-of-place. It's pretty bad in there and almost creepy. Looks like it hasn't been touched since the 70s or something and the casino floor is another great display of where I would not want to spend a dime. It smells bad and the croupiers are creepy looking.\n\nThere's a Krispy Kreme donut shop and a few shops on the lower floor and they have an entire part of the building that's under a giant, ugly purple down known as the \""Adventuredome\"" where there's some kind of theme park. It was closed when I tried to scout it out, possibly because it was past 10PM. It didn't look all that great.\n\nAs far as food options go, there's very little that they offer .There's a buffet but it looked terrible. We settled for Rock & Rita's for our breakfast and it was not all that great. There's a few bars but most of them are lame and past their prime as you'll be able to tell when walking around the place for over an hour around 10:30PM-ish.\n\nIn many ways, this place could be used a set for a sequel to Steven King's \""IT\"" movies or something. It's definitely creepy enough. Maybe they should just blow it up and build something else there. It might actually improve the value of the land and Circus Circus seems to be past it's prime... Way past it.\n\nI doub that I'd ever want to stay there again. There's many better options and most have a better location since Circus Circus is at the very beginning of the strip.",negative,neutral,neutral
"The other reviewers are not kidding. There are a LOT of kids here. Like, no joke.\n\nI like kids, don't get me wrong. But not in Vegas. Not when I'm trying to get my drink on.\n\nThe bf and I got a free stay here for sitting through one of those timeshare seminars. Free = good, I guess. The rate here normally I know isn't bad, but it's quite the hike to the center of the Strip. And that was in tennis shoes! Was I about to try it in heels? Hell to the no. We ended up spending quite a lot on cabs that could have been avoided had we been closer to everything else. \n\n2 stars because the room was actually nicer than the Tropicana, where I stayed the last time I was in Vegas - but that isn't hard to do. We had an awesome view of... the gray side of the building and a trash-filled alley. Awesome. Why am I giving this place 2 stars again?",negative,neutral,negative
Circus Circus home to Midway is truly a good memory for me when I was younger. Its more of a family casino hotel in the sense it is more kid friendly than other hotel casinos on the strip. I've been to Circus Circus countless amounts of time and it is a pleasant experience each time though if you're looking for shopping euphoria and gambling then search elsewhere. But otherwise I would reccomend it since it is cheaper than other hotels and offers about same amenities and serves the same function. You can always walk elsewhere to have fun and gamble and later walk back to sleep so its your call but good place and I always had fun. Midway can get addicting even for us adults so be careful about that! But otherwise have fun and go win yourself a teddy bear instead of just losing all your cash on the tables ;) It's Vegas! Have fun! Stay Safe too!,positive,neutral,positive

"Been coming here since I was a kid. Stayed in the Skyrise Tower before and it was great no complaints. This time we got the chance to stay at the Circus Circus Manor Motor Lodge. Its was the chepest rates. So we said what the hell let's try it out. Arriving I thought, damn its gonna be real ghetto with all kinds of weird looking people. Wasn't to sure about it. Upon arriving we check in went to room and it kinda looks like appt complex. Seemed really quiet and sane normal looking people. When we went in room I checked everything from bathroom, to cabinets, to safe, to bed and under bed. Looking for any nasty s*** we didn't like or looked dirty. But hey it was actually pretty clean, no roaches and no bed bugs! The bed was very comfortable, better then I expected! The only down side is that its a walk to casino and the strip. But not too far. So wear some comfy shoes. I wouldn't mind staying here again if Skyrise Tower is all booked. So people try it out, its not as bad as some people make it seem. Cheapest rates, hey more money to gamble and drink...",positive,neutral,negative
"Ok seriously? So this place is out of control. I will NEVER return. I didn't care for Vegas as a whole but this establishment really did it in. The service was absolutely horrible. They need some serious Customer Service intervention. At first sight I was mesmarized, as I am sure all Vegas Virgins are. We got an impromtu tour across the entire Circus Circus ground because they can't seem to articulate their own maps, but I don't blame them neither could anyone else. We ran into plenty of people in their Peasant Wing where the project housing/extra rooms are located. When we finally got to our rooms, after our hour long hike (with 2 kids and my mother, we were highly amused. I felt like I had been thrust through a time warp to the 1980s. WTH! My husband and I laughed for about an hour at the decor. I really don't think I had a decent meal the entire time. I felt like I was vacationing at a mall/airport. The mallport of America. The amusement park was pretty fun. My kids had a good time there. The rides were exciting. I loved the 4D theater and the roller coaster. The lines were not long either. That was about the only decent money we spent. That place needs to be torn down and rebuilt completely...starting from bottom up..all the way up.",negative,negative,negative
"It has a great area for kids, plus free circus act shows. If you aren't traveling with kids, then I cannot recommend this casino.

"We came over to check out the adventuredome... Lol big laughs... Well it's off the strip, so it isn't as classy as everything else, the adventuredome is not bad, but rides are limited and somewhat costly IMO. There are some carnival games/arcade which I love so we played some... Other than that, we were bored and left back to the strip!",neutral,neutral,negative
"I stayed here in the summer of 2011 with my husband and his family. We had three rooms in total. When we walked up to the Hotel from the parking lot there was an overwhelming smell of garbage. Inside the lobby we checked in, gotten our rooms keys and we went up. My father in-law however, chose to get us up on the wrong floor and we got a bit lost, not knowing where our rooms were. He decided to get some help and we were helped by a staffmember of the hotel. It was all friendly and professional. \nThe Rooms:\nMe and my husband went into our rooms and I thought it was going to be a bit of a run down room, but it was not! It was pleasant, good in size and neat. Instantly I felt more relieved, that was until we wanted to put some cash and jewelry in our safebox, which did not work. I alerted my father in law and he contacted front desk. They said that someone might come to our rooms tomorrow between 12:00 AM and 4 PM. Uhm, we're supposed to be in our rooms the whole day? We didn't do that and used the safebox from my father inlaw. But it was a bit frustrating that they could not send someone straight up. \nEven though the rooms we had were fairly modern and pretty, some parts of the hotel it self were a bit run down. When me and my husband walked towards the pool we peeked into some other rooms that were being cleaned and we were shocked (and happy) to see how the quality was in there. \nThe Buffet: \nA no go... It was disgusting, and very unsatisfying... Everything I ate there tasted like plastic. That was not even the worst part, when I went to grab food I noticed chicken bones on the carpet, lying between tables, anyone could have spotted it. When I went back to my seat it was still there, and when we left it was still there. We had been sitting there for quite a while and it seemed to me it was ridiculous that none of the waiters had picked it up. So I got a napkin, picked it up and dumped it on a not yet cleaned table.\nWe did go into the Adventuredome, but we didn't go on any of the rides. It does seem like a fun time for kids, but I got no clue why anyone would take their kids to Vegas to be honest...",negative,neutral,negative
"My wife and I stayed at Circus Circus for our honeymoon because my brother paid for our trip and was being price conscious.. not that there's anything bad about that and we definitely appreciate him hooking us up with a Vegas trip. We had alot of fun while we were there and was definitely worth it, but this is a review about Circus Circus so lets begin.\n\nThe place is definitely old and shows it. We got to the hotel and the minute we walked in the front door someone started trying to hook us up with complimentary shows and passes, but required a major credit card (if its complimentary, why do you need my credit card?)  We get to the check in area and there was nobody there. We waited about 20 minutes and finally someone showed up. Circus Circus charges a mandatory resort fee for each day you stay, and apparently from what I've read on other Hotel Reviews, pretty much all of them do... So we weren't surprised nor did we care to pay it.  After we got our room cards we proceeded to head to our rooms. We showed up on a Tuesday so there was hardly anyone around and that's understandable. We had to walk an ungodly distance to get to the tower our room was in.. The place really looked run down, everything was expensive and there were lots of kiosks everywhere selling useless junk at ridiculous prices. (i.e. Fake jewlery, hats and crap). Anyways, we got to our hotel room, and it was decent... about the equivalent of what you can expect from a Motel 6 or Super 8 as far as decor was concerned. Our view was overlooking the north end of the strip where you can see the Stratosphere and in the distance, downtown. The view was pretty nice if you ask me. The bed was extremely comfortable. The window to our room was partly open in the corner and was nailed in that way so we couldn't close it.\n\nThe food there was bland at best and I would recommend eating at other places. We enjoyed the free circus acts, its surprisingly entertaining. Come the weekend and all hell breaks loose... There are children EVERYWHERE bumping into you, screaming, acting like.. well... Children and we dare not try to go to the pool.\n\nThere were no attractions for 20-30 something adults, like clubs or anything like that. We would have to venture into the strip or downtown for that. The casino sections are amazingly boring and poorly lit.\n\nOverall, Im sure this place is great if you want to bring your kids to Las Vegas (why?... its Las Vegas.. should be adults only), but for grown ups, I recommend staying else where.  Other than that, it was an ok stay and we don't have anything else bad to say about this place.",neutral,negative,negative
"Review for casino only:\n\nI was at Circus Circus last night to go to their Steak House restaurant. I had forgotten how large the place is, but coming from the garage in the back, I didn't have to go to the main casino. I did anyway just to see one of the circus acts. Roller skating duos must be the rage in Las Vegas with a couple spinning there last night.\n\nThe place was cleaner than I remembered from years ago. It's not a place I'd go except for the restaurant, but it is OK.",neutral,neutral,positive
"The only reason this place got any stars out of me was because of the Adventure Dome. As far as entertainment for kids, it was fantastic and worth the money. I would not recommend eating or sleeping here. Their restaurants in their food court served bland food, not worth the money you pay for. We even tried eating at the McDonalds upstairs, because I thought I knew what to expect. The service was horrible! As far as sleeping there, they messed up our room reservation and gave us one king instead of two queens. We were tired from our six hour drive, so we opted to have a rollaway bed brought up instead of going downstairs to switch rooms. Bad idea, my daughter ended up getting lice! We know it was the rollaway bc my husband, two little boys and I slept on the king bed and we didn't get lice. We asked twice for our room to get cleaned and it never did. When I called for extra towels they took over an hour to bring them up. Our relaxing family trip to Vegas was ruined and our entire family was so relieved to go home.",negative,neutral,negative
"This place is the worst! It's run down and just ghetto! It's supposedly kid friendly, but I would never bring my kids to this shit hole! This was our first trip to Vegas so we had no idea this place was so nasty otherwise we would have never stayed here. It's all the way at the end of the strip AND you have to walk 4 blocks off the strip down a dark, smelly alley to get to your room! Yes, the prices are cheap, but if we ever came back to Vegas, we would pay the extra $20 a night and stay somewhere half decent.",negative,neutral,negative
"Wow, is there a negative 12 star? Seriously, the only accurate word to describe this place = Ghetto!\nMy GF booked a room here for her hockey tournament, thinking cheaper is better. This place is a rats nest! Cigarette holes in all the bedding, a putrid vomit tinge in the hallways, and the bathroom? Wow. All the towels were stained, and the shower curtain looks like a Petrie dish mold experiment! A new coat of napalm might help the walls and ceiling in there! If she hadn't paid up front we'd be out of this crap hole. Forgot to mention the drunk, sloth of a woman screaming at her man friend at 4 in the morning. Good times!",negative,neutral,negative

"If you are coming to Vegas just to party then this place would be good, As you likely won't be doing more than sleeping off a hangover In your room, But being here on business it was really hard to get good sleep, bed sucked, had a lovely view of the roof/solid wall, And crap TV! The staff is just okay we waited in a long line for over 30 minutes just to check in.",negative,neutral,negative
"This is my first time writing a review, and I did it because I had such a bad experience at this hotel.\n\nI got my stay here through another website i think it was hotels.com (not sure though) it was a good deal. 6 nights/7days king size bed with air conditioning and a fridge. Turned out it was at the manors not even connected to the hotel. I decided to upgrade when checking in. The lady was real nice about it and got us the upgrade real easy. Had to wait around about an hour or two because there card system was down.\n\nFrom first glance, the hotel looks grimy, old, and wore out. Same is said of the inside. It's stuffy everywhere and smells of smoke (which isn't to big of an issue for me)\n\n I went and got my key and went to pick up my luggage because I didn't want to carry it around with me, so I left it at the luggage hold area. No one was at the desk! and their were 4 other people waiting by the time I got there. 20 minutes passed before a lady showed up and started getting people their luggage. smallest quantity at a time. I had 5 so I had to wait until she got through all 4 other people. (she looked super annoyed with her job and looked like she didn't want to be here at all. no care about the customers/clients/guests)\n\nGet up to my room on 6th floor. My room is small with a small bathroom and a door to the adjacent room?? (Security risk any?) air conditioning didn't work, fan had mold on it, of course I didn't realize that until I started to get sick a day later from having it run. No fridge in my room like the deal said. Oh did I say I was put in a smoking room on a nonsmoking floor? because it was the only one available for upgrade. Well after a terrible night's rest, and getting sick from the mold they moved me down the hall to a new room.\n\nLooks Identical. only they gave me a fridge and a working air conditioner and no door to the adjacent room. Yet the room is placed in a similar location where my last room was, so whats up with that? the view from both rooms is terrible. You mostly look at a building in front of you and the roof of the main building area below you.\n\nThe Buffet Review: 1/5\n\nOver Priced, terrible selection of foods, and even worse in the taste department. After waiting in line for about 10 minutes which isn't to bad for lunch time. I got seated and went to look at the foods. Wide selection of choices they do have.\n\nMy first plate consisted of Mashed potatoes w/ gravy, fried chicken wings, mac & cheese, x2 sausage links, and toast. The wings, M&C, and potatoes were yucky. tasted like 3 day old KFC, because 2 day old KFC tastes better! The sausage links were cold in the center and under cooked, and the toast was just plain cold.\n\n2nd plate was a salad with olives, cheddar cheese, and ranch. Because the rest of the salad makings either don't belong on a salad or belong to a separate salad group. the dressings were miss labeled ( I don't think rang is supposed to be orange?) or they weren't labeled at all. The lettuce was dry and warm which salads aren't supposed to be warm. I also grabbed a plate of sliced cherry pie, my thought was how can you screw up pie?...Circus Circus did! it tasted like that fake pie you make when your to lazy to make your own or to cheap to buy the good stuff for an extra 2 bucks. Plus it was cold. If anything positive came out of the buffet it was the water. Because at least that they got right. Cold and wet!\n\nI'm almost done. Most of the people here are nice. The room keepers if your lucky enough to get English speakers are pretty nice. Unless they don't understand the word go away, or can't read the do not disturb sign. I was interrupted by several room cleaners on several occasions. They just barge right in without saying anything. I don't think they care to read the do not disturb sign clearly placed on the outside door handle. One of them came in while I was undressing ( which I wouldn't mind if she was attractive, which He wasn't) \n\nThe casino area. It clearly states no minors under the age of 21 allowed in or to loiter in the gaming area. I must have seen several kids sitting on the gambling games next to their parents which is illegal. I even saw a kid sitting at a black jack table, clearly under the age of 15. The waitress/servers in the casino area are not attractive but instead look like 40 year old ladies in terrible shape who shouldn't be wearing said outfits. Plus their service is terrible, they walk around saying \""drinks? Drinks\"" and they walk so fast you have to yell at them to get there attention. Then you don't see one for at least 20 minutes. cheaper to just sit at the bar. Plus I saw several of these servers just coughing on the drinks they were serving, made me sick knowing they coughed on people's drinks.\n\nOverall a bad stay here. Recommend if your looking for a cheap stay. better staying at a motel or something. Plus some health concerns here!",negative,neutral,positive
"Mediocre stay. As a kid I always wanted to stay at Circus Circus., simply because of the midway and Adventuredome. Never happened. Now as an adult my husband and I stayed INCASE we couldn't find a babysitter and had to take our son along. Luckily we did have a babysitter but unfortunately we were stuck with the room... March Madness weekend, everything was mostly booked and overpriced.\nCheck in was at 3pm but we wanted to check in early since we arrived at 10am. Check in fee was $35., umm no thank you. So we returned around 2pm after a meal and a walk on the strip and were able to get the room by then. There was a charge of $10/per night for the resort fee. Which includes wi-fi access, fitness room, pool etc.\nStayed in the Manor Lodge which is inconvenient because of the walk., but whatever. The bed was comfortable and the room was pretty big. The wi-fi was horrible! I could only get a \""decent\"" signal standing by the fridge in the corner. As soon as i walked to the bed it would disconnect. WACK! Speaking of the fridge, it was broken. We couldn't chill our drinks smh.\nOverall IF you can Avoid staying here, it's best. Especially if you have no children with you. But if there's no other option it's good just for sleeping/showering etc. Really that's all you need it for anyway, right? :)",negative,neutral,negative
"Don't go to vegas on a whim with your kids if you are a frugal person. I've been to Las Vegas many times before but never with my kids and never stayed at circus circus. This was the only hotel that had rooms available on a saturday night that was on the strip that seemed \""family friendly\"" for under $250.00. I was told at the front desk that all the rooms were nice and I overheard someone else say that rooms had been remodeled. Must not have been mine. I stayed at the sky tower for about $130.00 and the room looked like it had been the same since late 80's early 90's. My sheets had holes in them, the decor was dreadful, and the whole way to the room looked dingy and old. Lesson learned, don't stay at this hotel, and don't bring the kids. They where underwhelmed by the adventure dome and wished I had just taken them to six flags or knotts.",negative,neutral,negative
"Circus Circus has not changed much since 1995, except that the buffet is $15.95 now instead of $4.95 back then! The decor is stuck in the 1980's and the rooms are, unfortunately worse, with wildly circus-themed decors. Much better choices!",negative,neutral,negative
"I love having to purchase my own extension cords when outlets don't work.\n\nThe scenic view of exterior pipes is utterly breathtaking.\n\nI hate being treated well so I felt right at home.\n\nThanks for not providing a small fridge, microwave, or coffee maker as I love paying over $3 for a medium coffee and not being able to save this place's below average food.\n\nMy favorite feature of CC is still being charged an entire week when we decided to head home to finally relax.\n\nHighly recommended to anyone who finds camping to be luxurious.",negative,neutral,positive
"The hotel room was dingy which made it appear dirty. I had no idea my room would NOT be in the actual hotel, but in their RV/Hotel Manor which was about a good 4min walk. I was by myself, and female and every time I walked back to my room, I was being hit on and talked to by unsavory men. I did NOT feel safe in this hotel at all! This is definitely not an upscale hotel where you will find many classy people. The staff was also rude, and their buffet was akin to high school cafeteria food. They were an hr late opening up their Italian, and mexican lunch bar. They seemed to have no accountability. This hotel was very dark and outdated, I felt like I stepped into 1972 when I walked in. I would NEVER stay at this hotel again!!!!!!!",negative,neutral,negative
"My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights. We needed an inexpensive room for the weekend. Checking in was easy, staff was quick and courteous. We were told we would be staying at the Manor. The benefit to staying there was our car was close for us to use. However, you are not attached to the casino. The room was older as was the furniture. The king size bed was very new and very comfy, as were the pillows. We had a keurig for am coffee (something our friends at a higher end hotel didn't have). \nMy huge complaint is that 1 1/2hours prior to checkout our water was shut off. ( no flushing the potty, hot water to shower, washing your face/brushing your teeth). Water was returned 10 mins before we left. \nThis was not my first time in Vegas but it was the first and last time I will stay here.",negative,neutral,negative
"For $28, I'm not sure my expectations were ever very high. This is the kind of place where you can hear your neighbors having late-night sex (wait, that's probably just Vegas), the pillows smell like they haven't been thoroughly washed, and you see high-heeled girls getting into dark pimped-out cars at 6am. But it's cheap, and the kids love the Midway - we spent an entire afternoon playing the games there, helped out by $5 off each person's ticket that came with our hotel room. The gambling itself is OK, and we didn't try any of the food. It set us back about $15 each time we cabbed to either the main part of the strip or old town Vegas, so you have to factor that into your overall cost (it's a 3+ mile walk otherwise, in a not so great part of town). Would I come back? Well, it depends on what kind of vacation I wanted. For a total experience, probably a nicer hotel would be my choice, but if I want to optimize for spending my money gambling or shopping, I have no pride about staying in a place like this - why not? Just turn the pillow over - the other side is probably cleaner.",neutral,neutral,negative
"Very typical Vegas--I got a deal on Hotels.com for $119 for 1 night in one of the \""Motor\"" buildings. It was a little trashy (some peeling paint and a worn out comforter), but it was totally what I expected. When booking a room, definitely find a deal and don't pay full price! Beware that there are multiple buildings with rooms, some farther from the casino than others.",neutral,neutral,neutral
"Good:\n-Clean rooms, attentive house keeping. We called multiple times for towels and they were there instantly\n-Great for kids and family\n-Cheap rooms\n-Ample parking\n-Good Gaming. \n\nCould use work \n-check-in slow\n-parking, although ample, is a pain to get around.\n-place needs some touch up paint, very faded in areas. \n-signage is confusing\n\nBottom line, clean cheap room on the strip. Good deal.",positive,neutral,positive
"We came here because I couldn't afford much else. Unless you are dialed in, in Vegas you get what you pay for. The place smelled from the get go - but at least the hotel crew were nice. The room was clean but oldish. Not my favorite experience. \n\nMy wife lost here cel charger in the ice dispenser. DONT DO THAT! Apparently it happens more than you'd think. It took nearly an hour to get someone to open it up and get it out. Time wasted waiting for help.\n\nWiFI included but spotty.\n\nWe ate breakfast at the Vince Neil restaurant. The food was ok, portions were small. Go eat at Ellis Island Brewery it's great and cheap. The food vouchers they give you are pretty much useless. They take overpriced food and make it less expensive. We didn't end up using them.\n\nI really wish Circus Curcus could get their crap together. The whole place is overpriced for what it is and they won't be able to rely on $3 ring toss games to restore their image.",negative,neutral,negative
