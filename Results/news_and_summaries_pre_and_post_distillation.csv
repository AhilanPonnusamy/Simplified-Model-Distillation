d4d539170fa27f93859cd24e7074d02d219b4260,"Labour will ‘never’ walk away from the European Union, Ed Miliband will say today. In a rare foreign policy speech, the Labour leader will pledge to ‘restore our commitment’ to the EU and other international groups such as the United Nations. Mr Miliband has all but ruled out a referendum on Europe, saying it is ‘very unlikely’ there will be a transfer of powers to the EU that would trigger one. Scroll down for video . In a rare foreign policy speech, Labour leader Ed Miliband (pictured above) will today pledge to ‘restore Britain's commitment’ to the European Union and other international groups such as the United Nations . Today he will accuse David Cameron of ‘taking Britain to the edge of European exit’. And he will pledge to embrace the EU in a bid to secure reforms. ‘We will be rebuild our influence, and that starts with the EU,’ he will say. ‘I want a clear message to be sent to our European partners that an incoming Labour government will be serious about leading once again in Europe and serious also about reforming Europe. ‘Leaving Europe would be profoundly damaging to the lives of our people and the future of our country. We will never put the national interest at risk by threatening to leave.’ His comments echo a controversial intervention this month by Tony Blair, who said Britain’s membership of the EU was ‘too important’ to put to a public vote. Ukip's Nigel Farage . He was a foreigner thought to have been born in Turkey. But Ukip has insisted St George would be welcome in Britain today because of his skills as a dragon slayer. Yesterday on St George’s Day, the party announced that it would make it a Bank Holiday in England. At the policy launch, economic spokesman Patrick O’Flynn faced questions over whether England’s patron saint would have been welcomed by Ukip. In its election manifesto the party has said it would have a five-year moratorium on unskilled migrants moving to the country. Mr O’Flynn said: ‘Well, I guess dragon-slaying is a skill but whether it is one that’s in short supply for the needs of the British economy, we will leave to our migration commission.’ The party said it wanted to end a ‘cultural self-loathing’ about being proud to be English. Nigel Farage yesterday celebrated St George’s Day at a working men’s club in Ramsgate, in the South Thanet constituency he is hoping to represent. Asked whether Ukip would have welcomed St George, Mr Farage said: ‘I think there’s room within our immigration policy for heroes.’ Mr Miliband’s decision to turn his back on a referendum has angered some senior Labour figures, who fear it leaves the party looking dangerously out of touch with public opinion. But he will claim today that Britain’s hopes of achieving reform in Brussels have been weakened by Mr Cameron’s pledge to hold an In/Out referendum by the end of 2017. ‘This government’s approach to Europe means that even when Britain’s interests are shared by other member states, EU leaders are reluctant to support us because they think we already have one foot out of the door,’ he will say. He will accuse the Prime Minister of backing a referendum because he is ‘too weak’ to take on his party’s Right-wingers and his fear of Ukip. In an incendiary claim he will warn that Mr Cameron ‘has presided over the biggest loss of influence for our country in a generation’. Mr Miliband’s claim to statesmanship will anger Tory high command, who point out he withdrew his support for strikes on Syria for its use of chemical weapons in 2013 under pressure from Left-wingers in his shadow cabinet. But the Labour leader will accuse the Tories of failing to learn the lessons of the Iraq War. He will also commit to putting climate change ‘at the core of Labour’s foreign policy’, including pushing for costly targets to cut carbon emissions to zero. Former business secretary Lord Mandelson last night admitted voters were still spooked by the economic record of the last Labour government. He told Channel Four News: ‘People like Labour’s values and feel they are more in touch, but they have a problem about their record from the last government, and the last two years where people feel, fairly or not, that we allowed debt, borrowing and the deficit to run away from us.’ Lord Mandelson also acknowledged there was ‘quite of lot of fear’ among business leaders about the prospect of a Labour government. But he insisted it was ‘misplaced’. Mr Miliband (pictured above) is accusing David Cameron of ‘taking Britain to the edge of European exit’ With only David Cameron or Ed Miliband in a position to be Prime Minister after the election, voters face a stark choice on immigration policy. Here, JAMES SLACK examines the key differences between the party manifestos. NET MIGRATION . Tories: Re-state commitment to cut net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ from current level of 300,000. Make it harder for non-EU citizens to get marriage visas to enter the UK. Cap number of non –EU work visas at 20,700. Labour: No upper limit on net migration. Last Labour government presided over a deliberate open door policy which saw the foreign-born population rocket by 3.6million. Ed Miliband has said sorry for the calamitous underestimate of the number of Eastern Europeans who arrived – but, crucially, he refuses to accept unprecedented levels of non-EU migration were a mistake. MIGRANTS FROM EU . Tories: No in-work benefits for four years. Benefits for jobseekers stopped. Residency requirement for social housing. Citizens of poor countries which join the EU denied free movement. Labour: Prevent migrants from claiming handouts for two years. Support open borders with the EU. Would block in/out referendum or attempt to curb free movement. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS . Tories: New system of ‘deport first, appeal later’ to dramatically increase number of removals. Fit electronic tags on foreign criminals so they can be monitored by satellite pending deportation. Scrap Human Rights Act. Labour: Ideologically-wedded to HRA. Vague promise to ‘deport those who commit crimes while they are here’. Last Labour government released 1,000 overseas convicts without even considering them for deportation. FOREIGN STUDENTS . Tories: Clamp down on satellite campuses opened in London by universities based elsewhere in UK. Since 2010 party has closed 850 of the bogus colleges which proliferated under Labour. Labour: No mention of bogus colleges. Under last Labour government, wholesale abuse saw number of student visas issued more than triple. The National Audit Office found that in the 2009 as many as 50,000 bogus students may have entered the UK to work rather than study.",to'restore our commitment' to the EU and other international groups such as the United Nations.

ee18c099a044c40e4f790a13241b325962b8cd61,"The Queensland government has called a government decision to deport a single-mother and her son 'cold and heartless'. Townsville nurse Maria Sevilla and her son, Tyrone, will be forced out of the country within 28 days, after Ms Sevilla's appeal to the Immigration Department was unsuccessful. The single-mum initially  had her visa application rejected because her son's autism would be a 'burden on the Australian health system', according to the Immigration Department. Scroll down for video . Tyrone (pictured) and his mother Maria Sevilla have had their visa application rejected and are facing deportation back to the Philippines . After Ms Sevilla's appeal was unsuccessful, her and her son will be deported within 28 days . Ms Sevilla said she did not want to be a burden, and was working in Australia in an effort to give her son the best possible 'future'. Queensland Disabilities Minister Coralee O'Rourke called it a 'cold, heartless decision' by the Federal Government. 'I call on them to reverse the decision,' she said, according to the ABC. Ms Sevilla said she hoped Immigration Minister Peter Dutton would exercise his ministerial power and allow them to stay. 'It's like, I'm pleading for our life, for Tyrone's future,' she said. A spokeswoman for Minister Dutton said the Migration Review Tribunal had reviewed the case and affirmed the original decision. 'Most visas for Australia require applicants to meet the health requirements set out in Australian migration law,' the spokeswoman said. 'The health requirements are an objective assessment to determine whether the care of an individual during their stay in Australia would likely result in significant costs on the Australian community. 'The visa was refused because the child did not meet the health requirement.' Ms Sevilla, a single mum and nurse in the Queensland town of Townsville, has lived in Australia with her son since 2007. She says it is the only place he knows, and he only knows English . Maria Sevilla has lived in Australia since 2007, when she arrived in the Queensland town of Townsville - a single mother wanting to become a nurse, in the hope of finding a better life for herself and for her baby. Her son was diagnosed with autism at the age of two, six months after they arrived in Australia. Ms Sevilla told Daily Mail Australia the new life in Australia 'changed everything' for her and her son, and she was able to fulfill her 'dream' of working as a nurse. It was not possible for Ms Sevilla to work as a nurse in the Philippines, where she said university is only possible for 'well-off families'. 'Coming here and becoming a nurse has given me assurance for our future and a sense of fulfilment,' she said. Ms Sevilla also rejected claims her son will be a burden on the country. 'All of it could be taken away because the government thinks that children with autism are going to be more of a cost to Australian society than a benefit – but that's just not true,' she said. Ms Sevilla has made a petition and is appealing the decision to send herself and her son back to the Philippines - a place where she has no family and no network of support. 'Everything is here for us. My work, our family, our home is here, Tyrone's school.' Ms Sevilla's application for a Skilled-Region visa subclass 489 has been rejected by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection due to Tyrone's autism. The rejection letter states that Tyrone 'has a severe autism spectrum disorder, a condition that is likely to be permanent in nature'. It stated that he would likely need special education services, state disability services, Commonwealth disability services and residential care services. 'Tyrone would be likely to result in a significant cost to the Australian community in the areas of health care,' the rejection letter said. A spokeswoman for then-Immigration Minister Scott Morrison released a statement about the initial rejection. 'The visa was refused because the child did not meet the health requirement,' the spokeswoman said. 'The applicant was advised of her options for independent review of the decision. People can only seek ministerial intervention once a refusal decision has been upheld at merits review'. Tyrone is a 'very cheeky, happy little boy' who is thriving at his specialised school in Townsville . Before appealing the decision, Ms Sevilla said she had received heartwarming support from many Australians. 'I have received so many messages from mums of children with Autism; it's very prevalent in Australia,' Ms Sevilla said . 'As a mother of a child with Autism, I know it isn't a disease you have to cure, but one you have to manage. 'Tyrone is a happy child with full of life attitude and can lighten the mood of a room with his presence. 'The idea that he can't contribute because of his condition is just wrong. People with autism can be excellent at a whole range of things; he just needs to be given a chance.' Ms Sevilla is sad, not angry, that the Immigration Department does not understand Autism, and says that her son deserves a chance . Due to Tyrone's autism, even minor changes to their routines troubles him, meaning having their deportation would cause enormous issues for the little boy. 'Tyrone notices any change to his routine. Even if I drive him a different route to school, he'll notice and react with a tantrum. But once you calm him down he's fine. 'But if we're asked to go back to the Philippines, we'd have to start from scratch. Tyrone only knows English. He only knows life in Australia.' Ms Sevilla lives with her brother and his wife, with her mother only fifteen minutes away - or as Ms Sevilla explains it 'just a phone call away'. They are a crucial support for her and adored by Tyrone. Ms Sevilla says there is no support for them in Tyrone, compared to Australia, where her beloved mother, brother, sister-in-law, aunty, uncle and cousins live. Tyrone is very happy with them, and are a crucial support for Ms Sevilla, which includes caring for Tyrone when Ms Sevilla is on night shift. 'I have found a better life for my family in Australia with my close family. My mother, stepfather and Tyrone's uncle and aunty are so important for Tyrone and I. 'They are a big help, as any single mum would understand.' Ms Sevilla (pictured second from the left, in pink) and her son Tyrone (centre, in blue cap) say they have 'never felt lonely' in Australia, despite their challenges, because of all the support they have been given . Ms Sevilla says that through all her challenges, Australia has been a safe, caring place for her and her son. 'I have a lot of support from the community. I have my family. I have never felt alone.'

ab7f60c777bb14499a552267f5e109fd301df59a,"One of several Florida teens accused of ganging up on a friend by allowing her to be sexually assaulted was thrown back in jail Tuesday for allegedly breaking the conditions of her pre-trial release by threatening the victim online. Erica Avery was cuffed and hauled out of a Broward County courtroom after being accused of using the internet, which itself violated the conditions set just one month prior when she was first released on $100,000 bond. Prosecutor Maria Schneider said photos of the 17-year-old were posted to social media and one of them shows her using a smart phone, reports the Sun-Sentinel. Scroll down for video . Erica Avery (center) was cuffed and hauled out of a Broward County courtroom Tuesday after being accused of using the internet, which itself violates the conditions set just one month prior when she was first released on $100,000 bond (here, she is pictured at a prior court date) Accused: Prosecutors on Tuesday claimed Avery had contacted a victim she allegedly helped to hold down during a 2013 sexual assault . Avery and four other teens are charged with armed sexual battery and kidnapping in connection with the 2013 assault on a victim in Hollywood, Florida. Not long after their arrest, cell phone video emerged showing Erica Avery and her friend Patricia Montes leering over the victim as she writhed half naked and wept in the yard of the home of Jayvon Woolfork. Montes and Avery are accused of punching, kicking and pepper-spraying the girl before holding her down to be raped by Woolfork. On Tuesday, Avery's attorney told the court it was her sister, not Avery, who sent the victim messages. 'My client has assured me that at no point in time did she access the Internet,' Weinstein said. 'How is she supposed to control what her sister did?' The barbaric attack was filmed on a cell phone by Lanel Singleton. Along with Dwight Henry, the alleged rape gang have all been charged in the attack on November 1, 2013. The sickening clips shows the girls viciously beating the girl while the men watch. One male voice can be heard saying: 'They don't like this girl.' One girl responds: 'I told you we were gonna f*** somebody up'. As the victim begs to be freed, another girl says they should 'let this girl go home' but the attack continues. Avery, here with her co-defendant Patricia Montes, are accused of punching, kicking and pepper-spraying the girl before holding her down to be raped by Woolfork . Montes on Monday pleaded no contest and was sentenced to four years in prison followed by two years probation as part of a deal in which she'll testify against her co-defendants, writes the Sun-Sentinel. Avery could take a similar deal. The victim told police that she was attacked after smoking marijuana and drinking beer with people she believed to be her friends, including one girl who had been her best friend since kindergarten. The victim claims that she was kicked, thrown down stairs and had her face smashed on concrete, breaking bones near both her eyes. The videos, consisting of 11 snippets, show the victim being beaten, but they do not depict sexual activity.

951f71cb6dc8aacd4e328a561b9d2da80820b8d7,"A 25-year-old man left brain damaged as a baby after a blunder by doctors has today won his 23-year battle for £7.3 million compensation. The young man, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, now relies on 24-hour care. He was born at the Luton and Dunstable Hospital in September 1989, but was readmitted three months later, suffering a serious brain haemorrhage. Maternity staff at the hospital failed to administer a vitamin K injection shortly after the man was born. A 25-year-old man was left brain damaged as a baby after doctors at the Luton and Dunstable Hospital failed to administer a vitamin K injection to help the blood clot and prevent internal bleeding. He now requires 24-hour care and will do for the rest of his life. (File picture) The booster is given to newborn babies to reduce their risk of blood clots. The Secretary of State for Health admitted liability, accepting the failure to give the man vitamin K breached their duty of care. At London's High Court today, Judge Michael Yelton approved the £7.3 million settlement, to be paid by the NHS Litigation Authority. It awards the man a lump sum of £2,345,000, as well as annual payments of £181,000, rising to £192,000 - making a total of £7,385,000. Vitamin K helps the blood to clot, and as a result can prevent excessive internal bleeding. In the UK new parents are asked if they would like their newborn to recieve the supplement. Babies are born with low levels of the vitamin, but the amount is normally enough to prevent problems. Some babies are at greater risk, and are more likely to suffer haemorrhagic disease of the newborn, also known as vitamin K deficiency bleeding. Because it can be difficult to ascertain which babies are at heightened risk, the Department of Health recommends all babies receive the supplement soon after birth. Though rare, HDN is a very serious disease. Half of all babies with HDN suffer a haemorrhage into their brain, often resulting in brain damage. Babies at higher risk of HDN include: . Source: NCT . Judge Yelton said the man should not be named because he was a 'vulnerable person'. But he said he was 'entirely satisfied' the settlement was in his best interests. He said he was 'very pleased' for the young man and his family. The brain damage the now 25-year-old suffered has resulted in significant cognitive and physical problems, including a weakness on his left hand side, and reduced hearing. He also lacks the capacity to manage his own affairs, and needs round the clock care. His family welcomed the settlement, adding it will allow for specialist support, specially adapted accommodation and 24-hour care. His solicitor Arani Yogadeva of Irwin Mitchell said: 'Vitamin K injections are offered to parents as a measure to boost their newborn baby's anti-clotting processes shortly after birth and reduce the risks of them suffering excessive bleeding caused by a deficiently in the vitamin. 'In this case, midwives and doctors chose not to provide him with the relevant dose without advising his mother about the vitamin and the importance of it - a decision which has had serious repercussions. 'We are delighted to have helped the family secure vital financial support, along with an admission of liability. 'It will ensure he gets the lifelong care he requires and also urge hospitals to ensure that guidance is following in relation to the issue of vitamin K.'

With the rouble in trouble, Russians are freezing at home, rather than sizzling in India's flop-in-the-sun western state. Sorry to be mean, but it's all too good to be true for the rest of us. Blissful: Agonda Beach is one of the many relaxed stretches of shoreline along the edge of Goa . The beaches are more relaxed, the restaurants and bars quieter, the accessories less shiny. My friend Alex and I find direct flights for £348 return through Thomson. On arrival, we head for Ashvem Beach, in the north, for three nights at Yab Yum Resorts. Our seaside accommodation, with en-suite bathroom, is chic and tucked away in palm trees. We're paying £49 each for three nights. You won't find those prices in the Caribbean. On the beach, Goans peddling pedicures and sarongs smile and tell us we are 'very pale', adding: 'You won't stay that way for long.' Even without the Russians, the beach is a hive of activity. There are yoga and Pilates classes, massage sessions, trinket sellers, football kick-arounds, Frisbee games, joggers. Watching the sunset on Arambol Beach - Ashvem's neighbour - is spectacular, after which we take a ten-minute ride on a tuk-tuk taxi back to our hotel. Goa has 11 hours of sunshine a day at this time of year. And it retains something of its European flavour, a leftover from its days as a Portuguese colony for 450 years. One of its greatest assets is the food. The ball's in your court: Goa has a famously relaxed ambience, and is a real favourite with tourists . You can eat famously here for no more than £20 a head. After a few days in the north, we take a two-and-a-half-hour taxi (£27) to Palolem in the south and fetch up at Ciaran's Camp - a smattering of beach cottages costing £50 a night. It's altogether livelier here, with music blaring and enough nightlife to keep the most earnest raver happy. Agonda, a ten-minute drive away, is gloriously serene, with one solitary bar. Its genial owner looks a little downcast. His displeasure is our fortune. Which is to say that he hopes the rouble revives and the Russians return. Thomson (0203 451 2688, www.thomson.co.uk) and Thomas Cook (01733 224 800, www.thomascook.com) both fly direct to Goa from £336 return.

a1fee9ea774980bfbbaaa8480447f9257aa11f27,"Tragic: Olivia Bazlinton, 13, and Charlotte Thompson, 14, died after being struck by an express train . The families of two teenage girls killed by a train at a level crossing have been shut out of a meeting where they planned to challenge Network Rail bosses over their bonuses and passenger safety. Olivia Bazlinton, 13, and Charlotte Thompson, 14, died when an express train hit them at Elsenham station, Essex, in December 2005 as they set off on a Christmas shopping trip. The friends had been using the station’s unlocked footpath crossing to catch a service to Cambridge when they were struck by a through train bound for Stansted Airport. An inquest returned verdicts of accidental death – but it later emerged that crucial safety reports had not been disclosed to the coroner, leading to allegations of a cover-up. Network Rail was subsequently convicted of criminal negligence and fined £1 million over the deaths. However, campaigners say too many dangerous crossings still exist in rural areas – despite a Network Rail closure programme – and that ‘excessive’ bonus payments to executives totalling hundreds of thousands of pounds are not justified. The girls’ parents had planned to raise their concerns at a meeting in London last week organised by Network Rail’s Public Members, a watchdog whose role is to hold the taxpayer-funded body to account. However, their request to attend was turned down. Last night the girls’ fathers, Chris Bazlinton and Reg Thompson, said in a statement: ‘Bonus payments were made to Network Rail executives even after failures in regard to safety at level crossings, resulting in many deaths, including those of our daughters. ‘We had hoped that Members would challenge Network Rail on these issues and ensure action to improve safety at level crossings is speeded up. The Network Rail governance structure is seriously flawed and not fit for purpose.’ Network Rail, which receives a £4 million annual subsidy from the taxpayer, does not have shareholders. Instead, its activities are scrutinised by a panel of about 30 individuals, appointed by independent assessors for three-year terms. Fatal accident site: Olivia Bazlinton, 13, and Charlotte Thompson, 14, were fatally struck Elsenham station, Essex, in December 2005 . Last year, chief executive Sir David Higgins, who has since left the company, saw his basic £591,425 salary boosted by a £67,919 bonus, while network operations chief Robin Gisby, who has also left, received a £47,641 bonus on top of his £380,275 salary. In total, the firm’s bosses received £250,000 in bonuses last year. A Network Rail spokesman said: ‘The tragedy at Elsenham was a watershed for this company and the way it approaches safety at level crossings, and members of the families have played a pivotal role in this. As a result… level crossings in Britain are among the safest in Europe, but there is still much that can, and will be done to make them safer still.’ David Porter, co-ordinator of the Public Members, said: ‘The decision not to invite the families to the workshop was… in no way influenced by Network Rail. The Members are independent but their role is limited and they are not involved in the day-to-day running of the company.’","Olivia Bazlinton, 13, and Charlotte Thompson, 14, died after being struck by an express train at a level crossing in 2005. the girls’ parents had planned to raise their concerns at a meeting in London last week organised by Network Rail’s Public Members.","Olivia Bazlinton, 13, and Charlotte Thompson, 14, died when an express train hit them at Elsenham station, Essex, in December 2005.

Rosberg has again found himself playing second fiddle to Hamilton so far this season, which has led to many questioning his character and ability. Although Rosberg could only finish third behind Hamilton and Ferrari star Kimi Raikkonen at the Bahrain International Circuit, he proved over the course of the race he still has what it takes. Nico Rosberg duels for position with the Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel during Sunday's race in Bahrain . Lewis Hamilton sprays Rosberg with champagne after the Briton secured his third win in four races this term . 1. Lewis Hamilton (Britain) Mercedes 93 . 2. Nico Rosberg (Germany) Mercedes 66 . 3. Sebastian Vettel (Germany) Ferrari 65 . 4. Kimi Raikkonen (Finland) Ferrari 42 . Rosberg conjured three superb overtaking manoeuvres, one on Raikkonen and two on the Finn's Ferrari team-mate Sebastian Vettel. A delighted Wolff said: 'Everybody who ever doubted Nico saw Nico at his best, fighting hard and overtaking. 'We are four races into the season and there are another 15 left, so I have no doubt after his driving in Bahrain, which was exceptional, we will have a very strong Nico bouncing back in Barcelona (for the Spanish Grand Prix).' Rosberg is already 27 points adrift of Mercedes team-mate Hamilton in the battle for this season's title . Rosberg dices with Kimi Raikkonen . Asked as to what is required of Rosberg to overcome an in-form Hamilton, Wolff replied: 'To qualify on pole and control the race from there. 'We saw that Lewis qualifying on pole, running away and being in control of the race was similar to what we had in China. He was the key to scoring maximum points.' A concern for Wolff, however, is the brake failures of Hamilton and Rosberg over the final two laps. For Rosberg, in particular, the brake system in his car failed on the penultimate lap, allowing a charging Raikkonen an easy pass, although it is likely the Finn's pace at that stage would have resulted in him claiming second anyway. As for Hamilton, his brakes gave way on the final lap, but the 30-year-old was able to cross the line 3.3 seconds ahead of Raikkonen. 'We must be happy with one and three, no doubt about it,' added Wolff. 'But Nico losing second place because of a brake failure is a bit of a pity. 'We saw very hot brakes on Nico's car in traffic following Sebastian (Vettel) with lots of hard braking. We monitored that, but with the backmarkers and the lapping cars those brake temperatures went through the roof and we had a brake-by-wire failure on both cars in the same corner - Lewis on the last lap, Nico on the penultimate lap. 'Leading into the last lap it was under hard braking on the straight the temperatures went sky high. When that happens the brake-by-wire switches into a conventional system and then you are without weapons to defend.'",", toto Wolff believes Nico Rosberg was back to his best in Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix.

Twelve of the cases resulted in the pilots requesting a priority landing, one flight was diverted and on two flights the pilots made an emergency Mayday call. Among the worst cases, one incident report in February noted: ‘Fumes in cabin. Eleven of the cabin crew became unwell during flight, with symptoms of light-headedness, nausea and “sea sickness”. Oxygen administered. Aircraft returned.’ Victim? It is suspected British Airways pilot Richard Westgate, who died in 2012, had Aerotoxic Syndrome . The figures have re-opened the argument about whether prolonged exposure to the air in planes is safe for passengers and crew. Details emerged in a report broadcast last night by ITV News, which has seen copies of the Civil Aviation Authority’s safety reports from December 2014 to March 2015. These reveal 167 cases of fumes or smoke in the cabin, not attributable to faulty ovens, coffee brewers or toilets. In February a coroner warned that airlines must take action to prevent passenger deaths from toxic fumes inside aircraft cabins. Dorset coroner Sheriff Payne said pressurised air tainted with jet fuel is risking the lives of everyone travelling on planes. He issued the warning after initial investigations into the death of British Airways pilot Richard Westgate in 2012. The 43-year-old, from Marlborough, Wiltshire, had suffered years of persistent headaches, nausea and chronic fatigue, which he long suspected was caused by toxic fumes in cockpits. Mr Payne’s warning came days after the Daily Mail revealed how the poisoning fears over air in holiday planes had sparked accusations that airlines had been ignoring safety concerns for 15 years. The coroner’s intervention was the first official recognition of Aerotoxic Syndrome, thought to be linked to memory loss, tremors, lethargy, headaches, tinnitus, confusion, breathing difficulties and even death. Safety questions: Pilots have reported 167 cases of toxic cabin fumes or smoke in only four months. The figures have re-opened the argument about whether prolonged exposure to the air in planes is safe . Warning: Dorset coroner Sheriff Payne said pressurised air tainted with jet fuel is risking the lives of those travelling on planes. It followed initial investigations into the death of British Airways pilot Richard Westgate . Many former pilots, co-pilots and aircrew staff believe they have suffered long-term illnesses because of the amount of time they have spent exposed to cabin air and ‘toxic fumes’. The pilots’ union BALPA has raised concerns. Since 1999, the air industry has denied a link between ‘fume events’ and medical problems. But a growing number of experts warn prolonged exposure is hazardous. The problems are thought to arise when cabin air is drawn from the hot engines. Passengers are usually isolated from this ‘bleed air’ – but airlines accept that sometimes there is a leak and jet fuel contaminates the air with compounds called ‘organophosphates’. In small quantities, these compounds may not be harmful – campaigners say it is most likely to create problems for frequent fliers and airline staff. The Civil Aviation Authority said several expert studies on cabin air quality have been carried out in recent years. ‘The overall conclusion has been that there is no positive evidence of a link between exposure to contaminants in cabin air and possible long-term health effects – although such a link cannot be excluded,’ it added. ‘Passenger and crew safety is of paramount importance to the CAA and we are constantly working to enhance safety standards.’","pilots have reported 167 cases of toxic cabin fumes or smoke in only four months, official safety figures reveal. it is suspected British Airways pilot Richard Westgate, who died in 2012, had Aerotoxic syndrome. a coroner warned airlines must take action to prevent passenger deaths from toxic fumes inside aircraft cabins.","Pilots have reported 167 cases of toxic cabin fumes or smoke in only four months.

But while much of the effort has focused on Prince George and making sure he doesn't feel left out, more still has gone in to giving the nursery a makeover. Scroll down for video . Preparation: The birth of Prince George's new brother or sister is expected to happen later this week . Overseen by Mrs Middleton, both the Anmer nursery and the one at Kensington Palace, have been given a Beatrix Potter theme. Fittings for both are thought have come from luxury children's furniture emporium, Dragons of Knightsbridge, where Moses baskets start at £75. But in a curious twist, it is understood that Kate had several pots of pink paint delivered to Anmer Hall from the Annie Sloane store a couple of weeks ago. In a move certain to invite further speculation over the sex of the baby, among colours chosen was Henrietta, which is described as a 'beautiful rich complex pink with a hint of lilac.' Another was Antoinette, a 'soft pale pink with a hint of brown' that is redolent of 'old-fashioned roses and the colour of old plaster' and the third, Emile, a 'warm soft aubergine colour with pink and red undertones'. Home: The new baby will spend its first few weeks at his or her parents' Norfolk home, Anmer Hall . London pad: The new arrival will also have the run of a second nursery at Kensington Palace . Each pot comes with a price tag fit for a royal, with just one litre of the paint costing £18.95. Kensington Palace refused to comment on the story saying that they could neither 'confirm' nor 'deny' that the couple had plans to paint the nursery. Echoing the palace's line, a spokesman for Annie Sloan said the company could not ‘confirm or deny’ that it had supplied paints to Anmer Hall. Nonetheless, a pink nursery appears more likely than the African-themed one hinted at by Prince William in an interview with CNN. 'I'll have toy elephants and rhinos around the room,' he joked. 'We'll cover it in lots of bushes and things like that, make him grow up as if he's in the bush.' Boy or girl? Kate's pink coat and pink paints have fuelled speculation over the new baby's sex . Compelling: Annie Sloan has  supplied three feminine paint samples to Anmer Hall . Whatever the nursery's eventual colour, more work still has gone in to turning Anmer Hall into a secluded property where Prince George - and his new sibling - can enjoy a relatively normal childhood. The refurbishment, which has taken two years and cost £1.5 million, has seen new security features added to the ten bedroom property which also has a swimming pool, tennis court and extensive grounds. As part of the costly renovations – which also included installing a new roof, a state-of-the-art kitchen and a conservatory – William had the driveway to the property, which used to belong to his close friends the Van Cutsem family, rerouted so that anyone accessing the property is shielded by trees. More money has been spent on filling the royal nursery and with both William and Kate known to have traditional tastes, it's safe to say that that extends to the toy box. Prince George has been cutting his teeth on old-fashioned wooden toys, while his reading material includes the Curious George books - the first of which was published in the 1950s. Toys for the new baby will be no exception and are likely to have a homespun wholesome feel much like this £34 Anne-Claire Petit Crochet Lamb Music Box. Prepared: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge also have plenty of pieces left over from Prince George . Traditional: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have traditional tastes and prefer old-fashioned toys . One for George: The couple were presented with a Dorothy and Theodore box when George was born . Tally ho! Both royal children are likely to start riding as soon as they are big enough, much like the Queen . Kate, who has made no secret of her liking for traditional fittings such as Moses baskets, is also likely to follow suit when it comes to toy boxes. Indeed, the couple already own one, having been gifted a £360 Dorothy and Theodore toy box by 10 Downing Street following Prince George's birth. Another Dorothy and Theodore piece likely to feature in the royal nursery is the company's £550 rosewood rocking horse. William is a keen horseman and both Prince George and the new baby will have no shortage of steeds to choose from when they get a bit bigger. Indeed, the royal baby's great-grandmother, the Queen, has been riding since the age of four when she was presented with a Shetland pony named Peggy.",the duchess of Cambridge's new arrival is expected to arrive later this week. both the anmer nursery and the one at anmer Hall have been given a Beatrix Potter theme. nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo is preparing to welcome a second charge.,"Duchess of Cambridge's grandmother Carole Middleton has become a permanent fixture at the Norfolk home.

The High Court threw out rules introduced to stop violent prisoners being transferred out of high-security jails. The policy was brought in after fugitive armed robber Michael Wheatley - nicknamed the Skull Cracker – walked out of an open jail in May while on day release  despite a history of prison escapes. Michael Wheatley - nicknamed the Skull Cracker – walked out of an open jail in May while on day release and went on to commit an armed robbery which was caught on CCTV (left) Wheatley absconding from Standford Hill prison in Kent  and went on a robbing spree – pulling a handgun on staff at the Chelsea Building Society in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey. After being caught he was told that he must serve at least eight years in jail before becoming eligible to apply for release on parole. The violent thug had previously been handed 13 life sentences at the Old Bailey in 2002 and earned his nickname by pistol-whipping his victims. Following the scandal, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling publicly announced that the Government was 'tearing up the system as it exists at the moment' and introduced his absconder policy. But two senior judges at London's High Court have ruled that excluding transfers  for prisoners with a history of absconding was unlawful. Wheatley was eligible for release after eight years, had been on the run after leaving Standford Hill open prison in Kent on day release and failing to return. He was arrested alongside another man in Tower Hamlets, east London, after an armed robbery at a Chelsea Building Society branch in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey. The Ministry of Justice today announced they would appeal against the ruling. New rules were introduced after  Wheatley walked out of an open jail in May while on day release last year despite a history of prison escapes . A spokesman said: 'The fundamental principles of the policy are not unlawful. The court found there was inconsistency with the implementation. 'Our position remains that temporary release can be an important part of rehabilitating offenders but not at the cost of public protection. We are appealing this decision.' But the Prisoners' Advice Service, a charity offering free legal advice and support to adult prisoners, described the absconder policy as a 'knee jerk reaction' by Mr Grayling. The charity said in a statement: 'The Secretary of State's contention that he is entitled to ignore and contradict his own policy guidance demonstrates either his ignorance or flagrant disregard for basic legal principles of consistency and transparency in public decision making. 'The so called 'absconder policy' was introduced as a knee jerk reaction to negative press reports without adequate consideration for either existing policies, or its impact on the prisoners whose progression to open conditions was abruptly prevented.'","Michael Wheatley - nicknamed the Skull Cracker - walked out of an open jail in May. he went on a robbing spree – pulling a handgun on staff at the Chelsea Building Society. the violent thug had previously been handed 13 life sentences at the old Bailey in 2002. he was arrested alongside another man in Tower Hamlets, east London, after an armed robbery. new rules were introduced after Wheatley walked out of an","The High Court threw out rules introduced to stop violent prisoners being transferred out of high-security jails.

The England striker failed to train again on Thursday as Brendan Rodgers stepped up preparations for Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final with Aston Villa, meaning Sturridge hasn’t been involved in any outdoor work since before the quarter-final replay against Blackburn. Liverpool still have two more sessions before they travel south but Sturridge, who missed Monday’s 2-0 win over Newcastle United with tightness in his hip, would have to involved in at least one to stand any chance of starting at Wembley. Daniel Sturridge faces a fight to be fit for Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa on Sunday . Striker Sturridge was left out of the squad against Newcastle on Monday after being taken off at Blackburn . It would even appear touch and go as whether Sturridge will be fit enough to make Rodgers’ 18-man squad, given how tormented he has been with fitness issues this season. Liverpool will give Sturridge every chance to prove his fitness but the signs at present are not encouraging. The injury is a continuation of the problem he sustained in the 2-1 defeat to Manchester United on March 22. Sturridge missed England’s games against Lithuania and Italy with what England manager Roy Hodgson called ‘a small tear’ in his hip. Sturridge admitted last week he will not be back at his sharpest until next season and he will be glad to see the back of this campaign, having missed more than five months with a combination of thigh and calf problems.

Gerrard, whose 35th birthday falls on the same day as this year’s FA Cup final, missed several games in February and March with a hamstring problem but when he was fit for matches against Swansea and Manchester United, Rodgers decided to use him from the bench. He will be desperate to play at Wembley and Rodgers, who will be without cup-tied winger Jordon Ibe, must decide whether to keep faith with his current midfield of Lucas Leiva, Jordan Henderson and Joe Allen or alter his system to fit Gerrard back in.

Playing at Wembley will be a new experience for a number of Liverpool’s squad and Allen says a positive result against Villa is required to enhance their development. Liverpool are favourites to reach the final but the Wales international maintains there is no complacency in the group. ‘It’s the reason you join a club like this — the dream of competing for the top prizes and potentially getting some silverware,’ said Allen. ‘There’s a huge incentive for every player here. Villa had a great result on the weekend so they will be raring to go just like we will be. ‘That will make for a great game at a historic venue.

Ms Skinner said she was 'highly disappointed' to see the My Kitchen Rules judge use his power as a high profile media personality to influence in areas he had no expertise, in which she has refused to watch his reality cooking show. 'Here we are spending a lot of effort and energy in educating people about the value of fluoridation, about the fact that there are no risks associated with ­vaccination, or very low risks, and that there is no connection between vaccination and autism, and it is countered by a celebrity who knows nothing from a specialist point of view,' she told The Sunday Telegraph.

'I welcome the opportunity to ­discuss the value of fluoridation with Ms Skinner, but ask that she, or any other party, does not misrepresent my views, opinions or beliefs.'

'I realise there's plenty of controversy around alkalised water, but I would rather choose this option over drinking tap water or bottled water, as it works out cheaper in the long run, and is environmentally friendly.' Australian Medical Association Victorian president Tony Bartone hit back at the outspoken chef telling Daily Mail Australia that Evans needed to stick to what he does best. 'All evidence at this stage both reliable studies and research from universities, the World Health Organisation, and by the Australian Dental Association points to the fact that basically fluoridation is an important public health initiative - it does prevent tooth decay,' Dr Bartone said. 'Celebrity chefs should stick to their knitting and stay out of the debate - his comments belong back in the Stone Age.' 'People like this are using their fame and influence in areas that they have no expertise - obviously a top class chef but when it comes to scientific research and understanding - they are lacking.'

The Millers were sanctioned by the Football League last week as they played Derby defender Farrend Rawson in their 1-0 win over Brighton on Easter Monday after his youth loan had expired and the paperwork over an extension was not dealt with correctly. They have had to endure a nervy wait to discover their fate after the league said a disciplinary panel would hear the case at 'the earliest opportunity', while also indicating that the club will be open to the 'full range of punishments', which includes a potential points deduction. Rotherham manager Steve Evans beleives a decision is imminent on a possible points deduction for his side . On loan Derby defender Farrend Rawson (third right) played in the 1-0 win over Brighton on Easter Monday . The three-man panel is finally set to meet on Thursday, with Evans expecting news of his club's fate in the next 24 hours . 'It's going to happen very soon,' the Scot, whose side host Norwich on Saturday, said. 'It's not my job to talk when it is and when it's not, it will be soon enough. 'I've been told this morning that we hope it will be concluded by the time we arrive here on Saturday, whether that's today or tomorrow I am not 100 per cent sure.' The Millers have vowed to fight the charge, hiring top QC Jim Sturman to defend them, but a three-point deduction is thought to be the likeliest punishment should they be found guilty. But Evans insists he does not know the strength of his club's defence and has not been involved. Rotherham drew 1-1 with Fulham on Wednesday night, leaving them four points above the relegation zone . 'I am not involved in the case, all I know is the chairman that has spent many hours heading the football club on this with a legal representative, I've not been involved in any of the meetings because it is not my department,' he added. 'I have almost been kept at a distance. 'You have to accept there's been an error. Certainly, knowing people inside this football club, no one means to make an error. 'I don't want to cast judgement on people who make genuine mistakes. I have made enough of them. I have often said that in my career and I mean it.'","manager Steve Evans has revealed Rotherham will find out if they will be deducted points.

But the FDA has ruled that KIND bars are not as kind on the body as they purport to be. Investigators found that a number of flavors were labeled 'healthy' - brimming with fiber, protein and antioxidants, while being low in fat and sodium. However, upon closer inspection, it was found that 'none of the products met the requirements to make such content claims' and were in fact 'misbranded'. Mislabeled? The FDA has ruled that KIND bars are not as kind on the body as they purport to be . Indeed, Daily Mail Online calculated that one KIND bar flavor - not included in the FDA investigation - contains more calories, fat and sodium than a Snickers bar. A 40g Honey Smoked BBQ KIND Bar - marketed as 'bold and all-natural' - contains 230 calories, 16gms of fat and 125mgs of sodium. Meanwhile, an equivalent serving of Snickers contains 190 calories, 9gms of fat and 91mgs of sodium. In response, a spokesperson for KIND highlighted that nuts are to blame for the imbalance. 'Nuts, key ingredients in many of our snacks and one of the things that make fans love our bars, contain nutritious fats that exceed the amount allowed under the FDA’s standard. 'This is similar to other foods that do not meet the standard for use of the term healthy, but are generally considered to be good for you like avocados, salmon and eggs.'. However, New York University nutritionist Marion Nestle told Today.com that said the problem is not nuts and it's the 'hidden' sugary ingredients that have to change. KIND Bar: Honey Smoked BBQ (40g) Calories: 230 . Fat: 16gm . Sodium:125mg . Protein: 10g . Snickers Bar (40g) Calories: 190 . Fat: 9gm . Sodium: 91mg . Protein: 3g . 'KIND bars are candy bars making health claims, and thereby marketing them as healthy snacks,'  Nestle said. The four KIND bars highlighted in the FDA case include the Almond & Apricot, Almond & Coconut, Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate  and Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew. On April 14 KIND posted a note on its website stating that it was 'moving quickly to comply' with the FDA's request. 'We're also taking it upon ourselves to conduct a thorough review of all of our snack food labels and website information to ensure that they're compliant,' the message continued. While labeling readjustments will be made to certain bars, KIND reassures fans that recipes will remain the same. It added: 'We couldn’t be more proud of our snack foods and their nutritional benefits. 'Our entire line of delicious snacks made with high quality ingredients like whole grains, nuts and seeds will continue to be available wherever KIND is sold.' KIND bars,  the brainchild of New York salesman Daniel Lubetzky, first hit the market in 2004. The clear-packaged snacks quickly became a hit with consumers and sales soared from $15 million in 2008 to nearly $120 million in 2012, according to Fortune. In a bid to expand into the health food market further, Lubetzky came up with a granola-like cereal called 'healthy grain clusters'..

bc721db319cbdd6924537aeba7efd61619422d49,"They have become one of the most irritating accessories carried by tourists in recent years, but it appears the selfie stick has been a nuisance for three decades. Hiroshi Ueda, a photographer who worked as an engineer for camera company Minolta, claims that he first invented the selfie stick in the 1980s. He said he came up with the idea after struggling to get pictures of himself and his wife together while they were in Europe. Scroll down for video . Hiroshi Ueda, holding his extender stick for taking 'selfies' which he patented in 1983 while working for Minolta . After having his camera stolen by a child he asked to take their picture in the Louvre Museum in Paris, he dreamed up a solution - an extendable stick with a tripod screw at the end. The 'extender stick', as he called it, was designed for use with new compact cameras that were being developed at the time. Whether taking in a spectacular panorama, visiting a famous landmark or watching a concert; the chances are your view has been ruined by  a selfie stick on at least one occasion. Now the situation may be about to get a whole lot worse, because there’s a next-generation stick that can grasp a tablet as well as a mobile phone. The contraption lets selfie addicts take photos  of themselves using their iPad, ensuring they can capture the best possible duck pout or cheesy grin in their shots. The supersized stick is available on the website Accessory Geeks for just $23 (£16), suggesting that they could be coming to a street near you soon. He added a mirror to the front of the camera so that photographers could see exactly what they were doing. Despite being patented in 1983, the extender stick failed to become a success - mainly due to the poor image quality it captured. But that did not stop Mr Ueda from compiling a family album of family 'selfies' using his device. Speaking to the BBC, he said: 'The idea of taking a picture of yourself was very new back then. 'The philosophy behind it was that I didn't need to rely on anyone else to take a photo - I could take a picture of myself whenever and wherever I liked.' Some 30 years later selfie sticks are now hugely popular - used by narcissists and celebrities everywhere to capture images of themselves in their surroundings. They have become such a menace that many tourist venues, museums, concert venues and stadiums have banned them. Perhaps ironically, Apple - the company that could be blamed for kickstarting the selfie phenomenon by putting a camera on the front of its phones in the first place - has also banned them from its next conference. Mr Ueda used his 'extender stick' to take pictures of himself with his family while on holiday in Europe (above) Modern versions of the extender stick allow a smartphone to be held aloft and use a remote trigger to take the photograph or video. Mr Ueda's patent ran out in 2003, however, so he has not benefited from the recent boom. Instead Canadian inventor Wayne Fromm developed a hand-held extendable selfie stick in the early 2000s, which he called the Quik Pod. While his product has sold well, there are many others available. Mr Ueda said: 'My idea came too early, but that's just one of those things. 'I patented about 300 ideas, so that was just one of them. We call it a 3am invention - it arrived too early.' The idea of selfies, however, is not new. Remote timers and triggers have been available on cameras for decades. A recently unearthed photograph also showed that some early photographers adopted unusual methods to take their own photo - such as using a broom handle to hit the trigger on their camera. Michael Pritchard, Director-General of The Royal Photographic Society, said there is evidence of selfies going back as far as the 1840s. Selfie sticks divide opinion - some people love them and others hate them. But a growing number of venues and attractions have deemed them such a nuisance that they are banning their use. Last month the National Gallery in London became the latest major museum to instruct visitors that the devices were not welcome. It follows bans in galleries in France and America – including the Palace of Versailles and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Organisers of two major US festivals have also made clear what they think of selfie sticks. The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and Lollapalooza are the latest in a string of concert venues and historic landmarks to ban the use of the controversial tech gadgets on their grounds. According to NME , London's O2 Arena and Wembley Arena have also prohibited them, while Rome's Colosseum also do not permit the use of the gadgets.

Earlier in the competition the Third Round ties were split over five days due to New Years Day Premier League matches and to accommodate televised games. Reading had to play their FA Cup replay against Bradford in the last round on a Monday when they had played a Championship match two days previously. Steve Clarke wants scheduling of matches in England to improve so the FA Cup can be preserved . Should they progress to the final, that will be contested on May 30 leaving Clarke’s side almost a month without games when the Championship season ends on May 2. The massive Premier League match between Chelsea and Manchester United is also scheduled to be televised at the same time as their semi-final against Arsenal at Wembley on Saturday. Clarke claimed he ‘couldn’t care less’ about the conflicting match, but added: ‘I thought it was a shame in the last round when we had to play on a Monday night after playing on a Saturday. Reading beat Bradford in the last round but face a much tougher task when they face Arsenal at Wembley . 'There are things that we should do to protect this great competition. It should be special. ‘When we beat Arsenal, we have to wait four weeks after our last league game to play the cup final, this is also not correct. 'I probably need to go on holiday for two of them and then bring the team back in. It's a long break. ‘If we get to the final, what are we going to do from May 2 to May 30? What do we do? Everyone else has played, so we won't be playing games. 'It'd be a great puzzle to have though. Let’s talk about it on Saturday night.’ Reading defender Alex Pearce revealed the players are waiting until after the match on Saturday before booking any time off in May in case they beat Arsenal. ‘Holidays are off until now, you can’t book anything, you’ve got to just see where you are and it would be great,’ he said. ‘We’re all committed and dedicated to getting to this final.’ Arsene Wenger's side are in formidable form and beating them will be a tough ask for the Royals .",face Arsenal at Wembley on May 30.

196960e0ec65c2850c11c9fc8920f15810d2656f,"I really enjoy celeb watching. For me it's all about watching the parade of stunning women wearing dresses that I would neither be able to fit into nor afford. As I get older however, different things draw my attention. A clear sign that I'm firmly settled in middle age may be the utterly sad truth that, I am riveted by the tight jaw lines. And on a recent trip to the U.S. it seemed that I am not the only one. I spent my time there scouring the faces of the women - and men - that I met, trying to spot a wobby chin or weak lower cheek. As a matter of fact I couldn't find a single jowl on anyone. These women had expression lines, wrinkles around their eyes and on their forehead when speaking, but chins and jaw lines that were as tight as a girl just sitting her GCSE's. Scroll down for video . Forget botox or chemical peels the latest celebrity beauty craze is having a tight jawline like Emma Stone . And I'm not just talking about 20-something's like Emma Stone or Margot Robie, but even amongst the over 40's, and the 50-somethings, there wasn't a slackened jowl in sight. It's not just about being thin, there's tightness that on planet earth, as far as I can tell, just shouldn't naturally be there. So just how do they do it? As a 40-something woman who is sadly observing a jaw line that appears to be more and more desperate to rendez-vous with my neck each and every day – it has become my latest obsession. After some calls to my best insider A-list Docs, it seems the new trend in celebrity-ville these days is not about hiding your wrinkles, instead it's the Nefertiti lift, aptly named after the Egyptian queen famous for (amongst other things) her very defined jaw line. Dr Barbara Kubicka says she has clients coming in each and every day asking for botox not on their foreheads but designed to firm their jaw line. Dr Barbara Kubicka sees a host of celebrities at her Knightsbridge clinic and says that 'While the whole world expects it's wrinkles that age you, it's actually your face shape that's making you look older.' She has clients coming in each and every day asking for Botox not on their foreheads but designed to firm their jaw line. Here's why: 'The first thing that our mind assesses when it come to judging the age of the person is shape of their face,' Dr Kubicka says, 'Our faces change with time from a triangle (high cheek bones and defined jaw line) to a square with a heavy jaw line and double chin. The shape of the face is much more important than the lines and folds. In fact, according to recent research we universally recognise as younger, a person who is wrinkly but has a youthful face shape. Thus, traditional Botox on the forehead alone doesn't improve appearance, but changing the shape of your face and tightening your jaw line, does.' Getting a Nefertiti Lift, or lower face rejuvenation has become a must have in Hollywood right now, and you can understand why. Ashley says the latest anti aging treatment is the Nefertiti lift for jowls . Think about the love scenes. How many of us can say with confidence we don't have double chins when lying down? I dread to think what mine looks like. And these actresses are filmed that way and just as badly – from the side whist talking. How I dread those photos showing up on Facebook! Indeed, for those of us who live our lives 'off camera' or shall we say with less pressing incentive than our celebrity friends have, there's still a feeling of wanting to look the way we used to. The good news is though, that apart from a lower face lift – which lets be honest plenty of actresses have – for those of us who want to avoid going under the knife there is a lot of other stuff out there we can do. Indeed, Dr Kubicka of ClinicBe confirms that there's a lot that can be done without surgery: . You can jab it: Access to soft and fat tissue around the jaw line and under the chin can be corrected with up to 3 sessions of Aqualyx (which is a new and improved version of 'flab jab') It works to dissolve fat cells and allows us to pass them out of our bodies when we urinate. 550 pounds per treatment. You can tighten it: Loss of skin laxity can be rectified with different skin treatments like Dermaroller, Radio Frequency or laser and loss of volume on the upper face resulting in a lower face drop can be improved with Dermal Filler or Sculptra. You can lift it: Over active Platysma muscle on the neck that pulls the corner of the jawline down with every contraction can be relaxed with muscle relaxant injections such as Botox which gives an effective lift. Botox (muscle relaxing injections): Nefertiti Lift £350 (Treatments last 3 - 4 months) And finally Dr Kubicka says that the best innovation over the last couple of years is threads. These have been around for a while (remember Madonna was snapped with that suspicious scarring that was widely believed to be a thread lift?) Brand new to the market are PDO threads - a Korean innovation that is suitable for both lifting and tightening. It's far less invasive than traditional threads (there is no hook to hook them on) and there are many sizes and lengths of threads available which allows treatment to every part of the face and even the body. As much as they lift they result in an increase of collagen production and line improvement as a bonus. PDO Threads - Price on Consultation. (Treatments last up to 18 months) And with all of these treatments, subtlety is what you're aiming for. Says Dr Kubicka: 'The greatest advantage is that we can improve the lower face, lift it and tighten without adding extra volume (as seen before with the dreaded 'pillow faces look') which allows us to achieve not only a younger but as well more naturally beautiful facial appearance.'","- and 50-somethings, there wasn't a slackened jowl in sight.

A spooky dark visage that appears behind the child in this photograph has sparked online rumours of a ghost. This photograph was captured in Kanagawa prefecture, Japan - 'nearby some samurai tombs', apparently - late last year. The Reddit user who posted it online - a friend of the photographer - insisted it was 'not photoshopped' and that paranormal forces could be at work. 'I'm not saying it's anything - just that it looks an awful lot like disembodied boots and legs...' 'Obiaruf ' told users. Scroll down for video . A trick of the light or paranormal forces at play? There is chatter online about what the cause of this apparent black boot apparition is . Eerie: A pair of black boots are clearly seen behind the little girl - even though her photographer father apparently does not recall a person standing there . The Reddit user who posted the controversial image online suggested they could be samurai boots - although others are not so sure . He then suggested they appeared to be 'samurai boots to me'. 'I know there are several very old samurai tombs nearby. 'Again, not saying that this is what is there, just that, based on preliminary research, this is my best guess...' Photographs from the same set show the little girl with nothing behind her and the snapper 'swears' there was nothing behind her at the time. In this picture from the same set, no one appears to be standing behind this little girl . However, in this other picture, the black boots have returned . Another conspirator suggested they could be combat boots from the World War II era. 'My grandfather was in the pacific theater (Okinawa Japan) in WWII and I recognize what the man in the background is wearing. Its a US Navy Uniform from WWII.' But not everyone was so convinced by the tricky picture. Some users suggested it was likely an optical illusion - a trick of the light - or the presence of a real-life human being. Or both. 'Looks like a living person in boots and dark pants and a light blue, possibly denim colored shirt,' said Jack_Shid. Sceptics have noted the presence of a blue piece of fabric lingering behind the little girl . 'Because of the perspective, the rest of the person is hidden behind the girl . Last month, a chilling image emerged on the 'Toowoomba Ghost Chasers' Facebook past, with its owner claiming it showed the ghost on a young drowning victim. The photograph, which was taken in 2014, was posted on Facebook by Australian Kim Davison, from Queensland. Social media users are claiming that the white shape at the back of the image, circled, shows a ghostly face . Photo was taken at Murphy's Hole which is the same location 13-year-old Doreen O'Sullivan drowned in 1915 . Was it Doreen O'Sullivan' ghost? Ms Davison claims her daughter's leg was grabbed by something in the water . The image appeared to show two women and four children swimming at Murphy's Hole in the Lockyer River, south-east Queensland. But Ms Davison and Jessie Lu, the other adult in the photo, were adamant they were only accompanied by three children. It provoked fierce discussion online after it was revealed a little girl had died in the watering hole a century prior. A Brisbane Courier newspaper clipping from November 22 1913 included a death notice for a little girl who died in that watering hole. 'Doreen O Sullivan, aged 13 years, eldest daughter of Mr. James O'Sullivan was accidentally drowned whilst bathing in the Lockyer Creek on Friday afternoon,' the notice read. 'Nearly an hour elapsed, before the body was recovered. The spot, which has always been considered dangerous, is known as Murphy's Hole, and is over 20 foot deep. Ms Davison insisted: 'At the time of taking this photo there was nothing between us. 'I'm holding the little girl and that white head next to me with horns is not human, I can promise you that. 'Its fingers are on my shoulder and on my daughter's arm. They are long skeletal type fingers.' An admin from the Toowoomba Ghost Chasers Facebook page posted a negative version of the image, saying: 'Light flare will always show up as black shadowing when the photo is inverted.. and in this case the light flare is coming from full sunlight reflecting off the water onto the child' Tragic Doreen O'Sullivan was only 13 when she accidentally drowned in the swimming hole in 1915 . Disturbingly, Ms Davison claims that there had been strange occurrences that day as they swam in the water, which only firms her belief that a spirit was present. 'On this day my daughter had her leg grabbed two times by something in the water.' 'When I went back in for one last dip to cool off I did feel something behind me as I was walking out of water but tried to ignore it. Ms Davison was convinced the shadowy visage in the photograph was Doreen O'Sullivan's photograph. A sceptic responded to Ms Davison's claims, pointing out another possibility. 'The eye sees what it wants to see. In my opinion, it's nothing more than a splash of water,' wrote Max Meara. 'Notice the child facing away from the camera - their left arm has just surfaced, causing a splash.' Brad Glynn had another explanation: 'I think it is another kid just the sun is over exposed more on the face as they are facing the sun.' The 'Toowoomba Ghost Chasers' Facebook page administrators were not convinced by either explanation. 'We used to swim there all the time growing up and all I can say is just to be safe I'm never swimming there again!' they wrote. Ms Davison posted the photo on the Toowoomba Ghost Chasers Facebook page . The administrators were shocked by the photo, writing 'We used to swim there all the time growing up and all I can say is just to be safe I'm never swimming there again!'

6b5fb8e1c6cd57c9a5a8c5eb75e668d646c78c8d,"A popular Virginia high school senior who passed away suddenly this week likely died from bacterial meningitis, it has emerged. Madison Small, from Ashburn, left school early on Mondayand, after she woke up in the night with a severe headache, she was rushed to hospital. By Tuesday afternoon, her father, Tim Small, had contacted the Broad Run High School to let staff know that his youngest daughter had passed away that morning. On Friday, the Loudoun County Health Department confirmed she died of meningococcal meningitis, which causes membranes covering the brain and spinal cord to swell, My Fox DC reported. Loss: Eighteen-year-old Madison Small, pictured, passed away suddenly on Tuesday morning after feeling ill on Monday and it has now emerged she died of meningococcal meningitis . The bacteria causes membranes covering the brain and spinal cord to swell. It is the school system's first confirmed case in two years, the Washington Post reported. The last case in Loudoun was in January 2013. Public Health and school district officials said they do not have reason to believe her illness poses a risk to other students, particularly because last week was spring break. Loudoun County schools spokesman Wayde Byard told the Post that lockers at the school have been cleaned twice but there is no indication of an outbreak. 'It's a very tragic case... but there's no reason to panic,' he said. David Goodfriend, director of the Loudoun County Health Department, said a small number of people who had contact with Small would be watched for symptoms. Her close friend Devan Rook told the Washington Post that she had thought nothing of it when her friend went to the school nurse on Monday afternoon. Loved: Madison's family said she was otherwise healthy when her health suddenly declined on Monday . Family: Her father Tim Small, pictured center, spoke at a candle-lit vigil held for the teenager on Tuesday evening. Madison is pictured left with her older siblings and parents . Meningococcal meningitis causes membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord to become inflamed. It is caused by a bacterium that around 10 per cent of people naturally have in the back of their nose or throat with no issue - but sometimes it can invade the body. The bacteria is passed through direct contact with body fluids, such as through kissing or sharing eating utensils or drinks. Symptoms can include fever, headache, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and confusion. It is often diagnosed in infants, adolescents and young adults, and a vaccine is recommended for all children aged 11 to 18. The disease can be treated with effective antibiotics but it is important that treatment be started as soon as possible. Even with antibiotic treatment, people die in about 10 to 15 per cent of cases. And 11 to 19 per cent of survivors will have long-term disabilities, including loss of limbs, deafness, nervous system problems, or brain damage. 'Didn't think anything was wrong with her,' she said. 'In the middle of the night, she woke up complaining of headaches and stuff, and they took her to [Inova] Loudoun Hospital and realized it was pretty serious. 'They couldn't handle it there, so they medevac-ed her over to [Inova Fairfax Hospital]. At that point, she wasn't doing too well, and several of her organs were shutting down.' She passed away on Tuesday morning. Her father, Tim Small, also told WUSA9 that his youngest had seemed the picture of health over the weekend, when they played catch together. On Tuesday night, just hours after news of their her death, hundreds of friends, classmates and family gathered for a candle-lit vigil at the school. Friends remembered Small as a talented softball player who had happily mentored younger members of the team. She was also excited about starting Virginia Tech in the fall, they said. School Principal Dave Spage, who broke the news to parents in an email on Tuesday, said he thought there were as many as 400 or 500 people at the vigil, which he said 'speaks to her circle and her involvement here', NBC reported. Madison's father, who also has an older daughter and son with his wife, spoke to those who had gathered. Remembered: Hundreds of people gathered for a candle-lit vigil following Madison's death on Tuesday . Support: Her varsity softball teammates wear their jerseys and line 2nd base as a tribute to Madison . Vigil: Friends lit candles as they shared memories of the beloved 18-year-old on Tuesday . Memorial: Classmates places flowers on Madison's desk after she was taken fatally ill . 'Life can be short, we found that out today,' he said. 'Make the most of it: love each other. Don't get bogged down in the little nitpicky crap. Put that aside. Life's too short.' In a Facebook post shared widely between Madison's friends online, she wrote a touching post in 2011, quoting Winnie The Pooh. 'If there's a tomorrow when we're not together, there's something you must always remember,' she wrote, beneath a smiling photo of herself. 'You're braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think. But the most important thing is even if we're apart, I'll always be with you.'","a popular Virginia high school senior who passed away suddenly this week likely died from bacterial meningitis, it has emerged. the bacteria causes membranes covering the brain and spinal cord to swell. it is the school system's first confirmed case in two years.","Madison Small, from Ashburn, Virginia, passed away suddenly on Monday.

The young England star has moved a step closer to an Anfield exit after revealing in a TV interview that he is not ready to sign a new contract at Anfield. Sterling, 20, has been offered a new £100,000-a-week contract to stay at the club but admitted he is 'flattered' by interest from Arsenal. Follow the press conference as it happens from 2pm. Host commentator . And with that, Brendan Rodgers has brought to a close the broadcast section of his press conference. The rest of his quotes will now be embargoed until tonight. In summary, then, Rodgers has insisted that Raheem Sterling will not be going anywhere this summer and that focus for the moment is purely on his football. The manager said he was 'relaxed' about his contract situation and that Liverpool are a 'superpower' of world football and don't have to sell their best players. He did admit, however, that Sterling's interview was conducted without the prior consent of the club and 'took them by surprise.' 'The concentration a few weeks back was to purely focus on his football, and help him continue with his development at the place he’s made great strides over last couple of years. 'The last time we sat down with plays and representatives that was the intention. 'Raheem has come out and made his feelings clear on that, and hopefully continue to focus on his football until the end of the season. 'What he said absolutely underpins everything we’re trying to achieve here. Raheem says it’s his ambition is to win trophies, and that’s perfectly aligned with what we’re trying to do. 'This is Liverpool one of the great clubs of football world. 'It is an honour for him to play at a club like Liverpool and he understands that. 'What he’s saying is that he’s got two and a half years left, he’s quite relaxed as I am, he just wants to concentrate on football. 'I'm quite relaxed on it. It's part of modern game. People who look after players have different ways of working. The focus is purely on the football. He has been involved with the first team for two and half years and player he is today is because of environment and what we’ve created. 'He's got a lot of improvement to do and this is the best place for him to do it. 'He's not going anywhere in the summer. The focus on trying to make him the best player we can. Does money talk? 'This club has shown that’s not the case. Liverpool is one of the superpowers of football and the owners have made it clear and we’ve seen it before that money doesn’t come into it. If the club doesn’t want to sell it won’t sell. That’s that case with any player, Raheem or anybody else. 'It’s about continuing to nurture a young player so he can be consistently playing at the top if his game. 'For Raheem it’s purely about the football and he’s made it clear that he’s happy here. Trying to put off all the talk. He’s a boy who loves his football. He understands and respects the opportunity that he’s had. 'Still has two and a bit years left of his deal so it’s not something we’ve overly concerned about. Hopefully we’ll get it sorted out. On the interview... 'There was no permission by the club, it was something that surprised us all. He’s a young player who has to learn and sometimes they makes mistakes. Our relationship is strong. He will learn as time goes on. We all make mistakes, especially when you’re young.' Moving back onto the subject of Saturday's match with Arsenal, Rodgers says he is targeting 'at least a point' from the trip to the Emirates. 'We go into the game happy to play our game.' He adds: 'We need to keep the ball better, we need to be technically better.' Rodgers has confirmed that Sterling did not have permission from the club to do the BBC interview. 'It surprised us all,' he admits. 'He will learn we all make mistakes in life, especially when you are young.' Then swiftly back to the burning issue: 'Liverpool is one of the superpowers of football. The money doesn't come into it. If the club doesn't want to sell, it doesn't sell. Money has never been the objective. 'For Raheem, it's purely about the football. What the kid is trying to do is put off talk about him being all about money.' The conversation moves on from Sterling to Saturday's match with Arsenal. Liverpool have no new injury worries, with Jordan Henderson back in the squad and Lucas available to start. Reflecting on the damaging 2-1 loss to Manchester United before the international break, which left Liverpool five points behind their rivals, Rodgers says: Obviously it was a disappointing result. We have to make sure we perform [against Arsenal].' On the contract talks: 'He has two and a half years left on his deal, he's going nowhere in the summer' On Sterling being linked with Arsenal, Rodgers says: 'Arsenal is a great club, but this is Liverpool. 'I'm quite relaxed on it. It's part of the modern game. Raheem still has a lot of improvements to make. This is great place for him.' And the subject is raised straight away, with Rodgers saying: 'The focus is purely on his football. That's my only concentration. He is at a place where he's made giant strides over the last few years. 'Raheem's ambition is to win trophies and that's perfectly aligned with what we're trying to do. This is one of the great clubs.' Brendan Rodgers has just arrived to begin his press briefing... Laurie Whitwell: A sign of Raheem Sterling’s tender years can be seen inked into his forearm. The image of Wembley, which overlooked his estate growing up, is clear amid a cluster of tattoos. Rather than those two famous towers, synonymous with the national stadium for 77 years, it is the arc, unveiled in 2007, that is unmistakable.

Ms Ainscough, 30, died in late February following a lengthy fight with a rare and aggressive form of cancer known as epithelioid sarcoma. She spurned chemotherapy and radiation, choosing to fight the cancer with a controversial treatment known as Gerson Therapy, which involves a vegan diet and coffee enemas and does not have scientific support. But after discussions with 'oncologists, healers and specialists around the world', in her final weeks - the most 'difficult' weeks of her fight - Ms Ainscough began a course of targeted radiation, her partner Tallon Pamenter has revealed. 'This was a risky and tough decision, but Jess bravely embraced this last chance option,' he said. Jessica Ainscough (left) was planning to marry her partner Tallon Pamenter this year.

'Finally the walls were broken down between conventional and unconventional medicine - I don't know why as a society we must choose one or the other. 'This was something Jess was looking forward with sharing (with her followers). It was an exciting evolution from her earlier days of feeling that she had to be part of one extreme world or the other.' Mr Pamenter said the six weeks of her radiation were among the toughest the couple - who were planning to marry this year - had been through. 'Jess displayed a sense of courage and grace that I am yet to see in anybody else I have ever met - myself included.' The radiation successfully managed to shrink the tumour but 'some complications arose during the final stages of treatment'. 'Not long after, the words I LOVE YOU would leave my lips only to fall softly upon Jess's ears for the last time. 'I said goodbye to the love of my life that day and my heart has been in a million pieces since.'

Ms Ainscough made the decision to undergo radiation after the fungating tumour in her left shoulder became large and painful.

Mr Pamenter told Daily Mail Australia she planned to tell her followers about her new treatment just days after she passed away. Ms Ainscough was diagnosed with cancer in 2008 when she was 22 and working at Dolly magazine, a favourite of teenage girls. She initially underwent targeted chemotherapy to her left arm, according to reports, but the cancer returned a year later. She also refused doctors' advice to have her left arm amputated. Jessica's mother was also diagnosed with cancer in 2012, and, inspired by her daughter's fight, she also adopted the Gerson Therapy method. The alternative treatment did not work, and her mother passed away in 2013, an event which Ms Ainscough said brought her to her knees. Mr Pamenter said his partner 'showed me what it means to live in a world full of love'. She was laid to rest in early March.","Jessica Ainscough, 30, died in late February after a seven-year battle with cancer. she spurned chemotherapy and radiation, choosing to fight the cancer with a controversial treatment known as Gerson Therapy, which involves a vegan diet and coffee enemas. the treatment successfully managed to shrink the tumour but'some complications'.","Jessica Ainscough, 30, died in late February following a long battle with cancer. she spurned chemotherapy and radiation, choosing to fight it with controversial treatment known as Gerson Therapy, which involves a vegan diet and coffee enemas.

eaa0b26c0d47b82728aa48a9e74850296527259c,"Bald, emaciated and close to death: this is the shocking images on show inside a caged hen farm in Victoria. These were the scenes that greeted Animal Liberation Victoria activists who broke into Wagner's Poultry Farm in Coldstream in March. The photographs they took at the Yarra Valley farm give a chilling insight into the bleak world of caged chicken factories. Scroll down for video . Some of the hens found at Wagner's Poultry Farm were ravaged and dying . Some looked as if they had only a few days left to live such was their condition . Eggs were still being produced at the farm despite the poorly hens . Activists said they found birds living in terrible conditions. Amazingly, two weeks earlier government health officials inspected the farm, but gave it the all clear. However, several hens were in such a bad state that they had to be removed from the cages by the activists as they were in desperate need of veterinary care. 'During multiple investigations in March, our rescue team discovered deformed, sick and dying hens, filthy conditions and immensely dangerous working conditions, which are now being investigated by Worksafe,' Noah Hannibal president of Animal Liberation Victoria told Daily Mail Australia. Hens continue to lay eggs despite a dead carcase lying in the cage beneath them . Animal Liberation Victoria activists look through the cages to see how healthy the hens are . 'Photos and video were taken of hens with eyeballs hanging out, with mangled beaks, and completely defeathered hens. 'Hens spend over a year in small wire cages, as is standard practice in the egg industry. When they are no longer 'profitable' they are sent to the slaughterhouse. 'Our rescue team found many hens in urgent need of veterinary attention, who were clearly not receiving any care.' But the owner of the 6000-bird farm that sells caged, free-range chicken and duck eggs has denied claims that the animals were not being cared for properly. Two dead hen carcases are just left on the floor of the caged chicken farm . Dirt and dust hang from the hen cages that look as if they haven't been cleaned for ages . Wagner’s Poultry is a family business that has been operating for over 50 years. ‘Wagner’s is regularly inspected by the Department of Primary Industries alongside a veterinary practitioner to ensure Wagner’s meets all regulatory requirements and adheres to the industries code of practice,’ the company said in a statement. ‘At no time has the industry regulator raised concerns with the animal husbandry practices on Wagner’s property. ‘Wagner’s Chicken Picken shed has been specifically designed to ensure that all our poultry is selected in a stress-free environment rather than being chased and caught in the paddock.’ Nothing to see here: One hen with a mangled beak looks forlornly out through its cage . Hundreds of hens stand in rows of cages as they lay eggs in pretty dire conditions . Dirty and emaciated hens stand in their cages with no room to move . The government department responsible for animal welfare in commercial facilities also confirmed two recent inspections did not find any breaches under animal cruelty laws. However, Mr Hannibal maintained that not only is the farm a hell hole for hens, it is also extremely unsafe for workers. 'Narrow and flimsy walkways next to the central cages drop directly into manure pits below,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'This presents a huge danger to any humans working in the shed who are at risk of falling down to the excrement pit a floor below - when they attempt to populate and depopulate the cages, or carry out the ‘daily inspection’ required by law. An Animal Liberation Victoria activist lifts up one of the hens to show how bad it looks . Another Animal Liberation Victoria activist takes a dirty and exhausted hen from one of the cages . Webs and dirt hang from the ceiling and cages where the hens as an Animal Liberation Victoria activist looks on in shock . 'Many people consider free range eggs to be an ethical alternative to these cruel battery systems that are in operation. 'But consumers should realise that all eggs, whether they are caged, barn or 'free range', cause enormous suffering and death.'",animal liberation activists broke into a caged chicken farm in coldstream in march. they found hens living in terrible conditions. some looked as if they had only a few days left to live. hens continue to lay eggs despite a dead carcase lying in the cage.,Animal Liberation Victoria activists broke into Wagner's Poultry Farm in Coldstream in March.

de3e9bc514d1e63829b9198c6b710cbc6d5ffffe,"Nasa has spotted an exoplanet 13,000 light-years away, making it one of the most distant planets ever found. Known as 'Ogle-2014-BLG-0124Lb,' the gas giant was detected by the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Ogle Warsaw Telescope in Chile. The planet is half as massive as Jupiter and could help astronomers gain a better understanding of the distribution of planets in the Milky Way. Astronomers have spotted one of the most distant planets ever found. Known as 'Ogle-2014-BLG-0124Lb,' the gas giant was detected by the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Ogle Warsaw Telescope in Chile. Most of the planets we know about are around 10-100 times closer . The planet was discovered using a technique known as microlensing. This happens when one star happens to pass in front of another, and its gravity acts as a lens to magnify and brighten the more distant star's light. If that foreground star happens to have a planet in orbit around it, the planet might cause a blip in the magnification. Astronomers are using these blips to find and characterise planets tens of thousands of light-years away in the central bulge of our galaxy, where star crossings are more common. Most of the planets we know about are around 10-100 times closer than Ogle-2014-BLG-0124, claims Jennifer Yee of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. 'We don't know if planets are more common in our galaxy's central bulge or the disk of the galaxy, which is why these observations are so important,' she added. The discovery demonstrates that Spitzer - from its unique perch in space - can be used to help solve the puzzle of how planets are spread out in our galaxy. The planet was discovered using a technique known as microlensing. This happens when one star happens to pass in front of another, and its gravity acts as a lens to magnify and brighten the more distant star's light. If that foreground star happens to have a planet in orbit around it, the planet might cause a blip in the magnification. Astronomers are using these blips to find and characterise planets tens of thousands of light-years away in the central bulge of our galaxy, where star crossings are more common. Our sun is located in the suburbs of the galaxy, about two-thirds of the way out from the centre. The microlensing technique as a whole has yielded about 30 planet discoveries so far, with the farthest residing about 25,000 light-years away. 'Microlensing experiments are already detecting planets from the solar neighborhood to almost the center of the Milky Way,' said co-author Andrew Gould of The Ohio State University, Columbus. 'And so they can, in principle, tell us the relative efficiency of planet formation across this huge expanse of our galaxy.' This infographic explains how the Spitzer Space Telescope can be used in tandem with a telescope on the ground to measure the distances to planets. The planet was dicovered via microlensing which happens when one star passes in front of another, and its gravity acts as a lens to magnify the more distant star's light . Microlensing complements other planet-hunting tools, such as the Kepler mission, which has found more than 1,000 planets closer to home. But it faces one key problem: This method can't always precisely narrow down the distance to the stars and planets being observed. While a passing star may magnify the light of a more distant star, it rarely can be seen itself, making the task of measuring how far away it is challenging. Of the 30 planets discovered with microlensing so far, roughly half cannot be pinned down to a precise location. The result is like a planetary treasure map lacking in X's. That's where Spitzer can help out, thanks to its remote Earth-trailing orbit. Spitzer circles our sun, and is currently about 128 million miles (207 million km) away from Earth. That's farther from Earth than Earth is from our sun. When Spitzer watches a microlensing event simultaneously with a telescope on Earth, it sees the star brighten at a different time, due to the large distance between the two telescopes and their unique vantage points. This technique is generally referred to as parallax. 'Spitzer is the first space telescope to make a microlens parallax measurement for a planet,' said Yee. Data from the microlensing event is seen here.  If the foreground star is circled by a planet, the planet's gravity can alter the magnification over a shorter period, seen in the plot in the form of spikes and a dip . 'Traditional parallax techniques that employ ground-based telescopes are not as effective at such great distances.' Using space telescopes to observe microlensing events is tricky. Ground telescopes send out alerts to the astronomy community when an event starts, but the activity can quickly fade, lasting on average about 40 days. In the case of the newfound planet, the duration of the microlensing event happened to be unusually long, about 150 days. Both Spitzer and Ogle's telescopes detected the telltale planetary blip in the magnification, with Spitzer seeing it 20 days earlier. This time delay between viewing of the event by Ogle and Spitzer was used to calculate the distance to the star and its planet. Knowing the distance allowed the scientists also to determine the mass of the planet, which is about half that of Jupiter. 'We've mainly explored our own solar neighborhood so far,' said Sebastiano Calchi Novati, a Visiting Sagan Fellow at Nasa's Exoplanet Science Institute. 'Now we can use these single lenses to do statistics on planets as a whole and learn about their distribution in the galaxy.'","spotted an exoplanet 13,000 light-years away, making it one of the most distant planets ever found.

As NSW police sources told Daily Mail Australia a formal investigation is 'definitely' under way into Wednesday's incident, friends of Hafeez Batthi, 33, and his wife, Khalida, 26 painted a picture of the Islamic couple as 'committed' members of the community in Brisbane. The family regularly attend the Holland Park mosque, community spokesman Ali Kadri said, and they are raising a newborn baby son, Mohammad, in the country which they are grateful to call home. The couple were in Sydney for just a day when they were abused by an unknown woman on an Airport Line train on Wednesday afternoon. Stacey Eden, 23, overheard the ranter insulting the Muslim couple as 'ISIS terrorists' and was recorded on video standing up for the couple. Scroll down for video . Abused on the train: Young parents Hafeez Batthi, 33, and his wife, Khalida, 26, have been described as 'hardworking, honest and kind' by members of the local Islamic community . Not going to take it anymore: Stacey Eden (pictured) made a bold stand in defence of a Muslim couple who faced a racially-charged tirade on a Sydney train on Wednesday afternoon . 'Stacey thanks again for your support for us on that day...I generally believe that you and many other Australian do respect all religions,' Mr Bhatti posted . Now, in an extraordinary act of gratitude, the Brisbane couple's mosque in Holland Park has offered Ms Eden and her partner an all-expenses-paid trip to visit the Gold Coast for a night and to see their mosque. Ms Eden, a blood collector for a pathology company who was born and bred in Sydney's eastern suburbs, said she was planning to consider the 'lovely' offer after the overwhelming wave of international media attention passes. Mr Bhatti told Daily Mail Australia he was shocked by the ugly incident, which occurred on the Airport Line train around 1:40pm on Wednesday. 'She asked my wife why she was wearing a scarf when it was hot outside - when my wife answered her I thought the woman was asking to be friendly,' Mr Bhatti said. 'Then she started saying Muslims like us are trying to conquer Australia and behead everyone here. We were absolutely shocked. 'It was just very disappointing.' Mr Bhatti said another woman nearby supported the racist woman, and the incident caused his family to miss its flight home. 'She said all Muslims should be kicked out of Australia - I tried to calm things down by telling her we love everyone,' Mr Bhatti said. He also said his wife was 'very shaken up' after the incident, to the extent she questioned if it was worth staying in Australia. Hafeez Bhatti, who was racially abused along with his wife on a Sydney train, thanked the woman who stood up for them . Police are urging anyone who witnessed the attack, which was caught on camera, to come forward . 'Stacey thanks again for your support for us on that day...I generally believe that you and many other Australian do respect all religions,' Mr Bhatti said on his Facebook account . 'This sort of thing has happened before, but you try to ignore it and the ignorant people behind it; there are lots of very good people in Australian and only a few bad ones,' he said. 'God bless Stacey Eden who supported us.' Mr Bhatti reached out to Ms Eden on his Facebook page after the story emerged. 'Stacey thanks again for your support for us on that day...I generally believe that you and many other Australian do respect all religions,' Mr Bhatti posted. Ms Eden was scheduled to meet police on Friday afternoon and detectives were attempting to contact Mr and Mrs Bhatti. On Wednesday afternoon, Mr Bhatti vented his frustrations with the attack, when he posted: 'once again, victim of racism by an old Christian lady.' He also discussed the events and said it started after the woman touched his wife's head like she was blessing her, before 'she started her ignorant comments'. Rant: Video shows this woman launching into a fiery spray about Islam, bringing up beheadings and the marriage of children while berating a Muslim woman for wearing a black headscarf . Ms Eden, who recorded a snippet of the conversation, fired back at the woman in defence of the Muslim couple (above): 'Have some respect... What's that got to do with this poor lady?' In her recording of the incident, Ms Eden is heard fuming:  'She wears it (her hijab) for herself, OK!' 'She wears it because she wants to be modest with her body, not because of people like you who are going to sit there and disrespect her.' Ms Eden said she became really upset after the woman allegedly branded 'all Muslims ISIS supporters' and insulted the woman's husband and headscarf. Ms Eden was not having a bar of it. 'That is not her doing it. That is a minority of people. Not a majority of people OK? 'It doesn't matter what they're doing... Have some respect, have some respect,' she said, as the woman continued on her tirade. 'It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. What's that got to do with this poor lady? What's that got to do with her?' 'She was saying some pretty horrible and hurtful things before I spoke up then as soon I started defending them she stopped' The Muslim couple told Stacey Eden (left, right) that they were 'very grateful' for her stand . 'Nothing,' the ranter replied. 'Exactly!' Ms Eden fired back. 'You're the one who started the argument!' the woman said. Ms Eden then instructed the woman to be silent. 'No, you're the one sitting there saying things under your breath, shut your mouth, simple. 'You shut your mouth,' the woman replied. 'No, you shut your mouth. You've got nothing nice to say, don't say anything, simple.' Ms Eden recorded a short snippet of the incident - not the whole alleged tirade - on her phone, ending with the passenger telling her to 'breathe'. She told Daily Mail Australia the Muslim couple and the angry woman alighted the train at Sydney International Airport. Ms Eden told Daily Mail Australia the couple alighted the train at Sydney International Airport . 'I missed my stop because I wanted to stay on and make sure they were OK,' said Ms Eden, who was on her way home to Mascot . 'I missed my stop because I wanted to stay on and make sure they were OK,' said Ms Eden, who was on her way home to Mascot. Ms Eden said the woman was saying 'horrible and hurtful things'. 'She told me if I was in their country I would have been stoned to death because I was wearing a dress. 'I missed my stop because I wanted to stay on and make sure they were OK,' said Ms Eden, who was on her way home to Mascot . 'She was saying a lot of things I just got to the point where I had heard enough.' The Muslim couple were 'very grateful' for her stand, she said. Police and Sydney Trains have not yet received any reports of the incident. The Islamophobia Register Australia group issued a statement praising Ms Eden's actions shortly after Daily Mail Australia's report. 'We are heartened by Stacey's actions - she is a reflection of 'Team Humanity' and we hope that her actions inspire others to stand up against racial or religious vilification,' it said. The group said they were disappointed by the remarks of the woman in the video. 'The sentiments expressed by the woman however sadly form part of the broader false and deeply damaging narrative whereby the criminal actions of groups like Daesh [Islamic State] are extrapolated to all 1.5+ billion Muslims'. The group's founder, Mariam Veiszadeh, told Daily Mail Australia incidents of abuse against Muslim women were becoming increasingly common. ''I'm very conscious of ensuring that I have sufficient storage space on my phone to ensure I will be able to record incidents should I either be the victim in an incident (or a witness),' she said. A hijab-wearing woman told the ABC last month she was subject to a physical and verbal assault on a Sydney train, with a man allegedly shoulder-charging her and hitting her with his bag and leg. Mariam Veiszadeh (pictured), a lawyer and public advocate for the rights of Muslims, says incidents such as these are increasingly common . 'I'm very conscious of ensuring that I have sufficient storage space on my phone to ensure I will be able to record incidents should I either be the victim in an incident (or a witness)' Mariam has been the target of racist attacks herself . 'It was a fully crowded train but nobody said anything. People were just listening. I know they were scared,' Hina said. As for Ms Eden, she told Daily Mail Australia she was already overwhelmed by positive comments she had received online, having posted the video just yesterday. 'Good on you for sticking up for whats right more people should be doing the same,' wrote punter Rachel Lambert. 'Well I don't know you but thank you, thank you for understanding,' said Shahiq Sarkar. Overwhelming response: Ms Eden has been bombarded with positive comments since the video appeared online . 'I hope some day when you need help and are boxed in a corner someone as bright as you is there to support you just like you did for those poor souls. 'We really need to look for the best in people and understand that its a few rotten apples who try to spoil the lot. 'All the best wishes for you.' One comment even asked: 'RU single? Lol'.

However, their plans for this year may not involve actually supporting Clinton's White House bid. A source has told the DailyMail.com Bagniewski, who ran for Des Moines City Council in 2013, losing by 270 votes, is in talks with Martin O’Malley’s people and may support him. Indeed, Bagniewski revealed to the Des Moines Register that he had been hosting an event for O'Malley last Thursday. O'Malley, who has just completed two terms as Maryland governor, is said to be considering running for president himself. The Democrat, 52, is expected to declare in May, but is keeping relatively tight-lipped about his intentions. 'My wife and I will make a decision on that when the time is right,' O'Malley told the Baltimore Sun earlier this year. But it seems Clinton's campaign team can breathe a sigh of relief: Bagniewski went on to tell the Register: 'O'Malley's great - but for me, Hillary Clinton is just head and shoulders above all the competition.' Julie Stauch is another person who appears on the video with strong links to the Democrat party . Stauch, an Iowa resident, is the former state senate campaign manager for Democrat Wendy Davis . Meanwhile Stauch, who is filmed in her West Des Moines garden, is a former state senate campaign manager for Democrat Wendy Davis, who unsuccessfully ran to be governor of Texas in 2014. Davis is best-known for he 11-hour filibuster to block a bill which would have meant the closure of almost every abortion clinic in the state. Stauch has worked in a PR office for Planned Parenthood, and a LinkedIn profile now shows her as the group’s top lobbyist in Iowa. However, in the video she is a woman famed for the produce gleaned from her Iowa garden. 'It's spring, and we are starting to get the garden ready - and my tomatoes are legendary in my own neighborhood,' she said. Jared Milrad (pictured right) and fiancé Nate Johnson have also been revealed as campaigning Democrats . The couple, who are planning a summer wedding, were featured walking hand in hand during Clinton's video . The video, which has had 3,477,630 on YouTube since its launch on Sunday, has quickly become one of the most viewed political broadcasts of the year - a fact which will no doubt help Clinton as she begins meeting people in Iowa today. Featuring snappy music, and showing Clinton for less than half the running time, it is a dramatic departure from the campaign launch of seven years ago, which showed the Secretary of State on a couch, talking about ending the Iraq war, shrinking deficits and expanding affordable health care. The 2015 video has managed to strike a chord with a range of people, with Democrat campaigners Milrad and Johnson talking about their up-coming nuptials capturing people's imagination. Milrad's voice is heard in a voiceover saying: 'I’m getting married this summer to someone I really care about.' Milrad, who did not know they would be on the video, said he was overjoyed to be part of the Clinton rollout - and part of a large-scale change in U.S. social attitudes. 'It shows how far we've come,' said Milrad, 31-year-old lawyer and social activist, pleased that public support for same-sex marriage rights has grown so far as to appear in a presidential campaign launch. Mr Johnson, 30, is a project manager for a health care consulting company. The couple will get married in July in a Chicago park bordering Lake Michigan then have their reception at a LGBT community center, The Washington Blade reported. The couple told The Blade that they would be making financial contributions to Clinton's campaign and would volunteer. Both have previously volunteered in presidential campaigns. Johnson supported Clinton in 2008 while Milrad worked for Obama in New Hampshire. Milrad, who is the founder of social enterprise program the Civic Legal Corps, worked for Obama during the 2008 Democrat primaries in New Hampshire when the President was running against Clinton .
