According to South Korean law, Kim's trial must begin within 14 days of receiving today's indictment.

That wound measured 10 centimeters (4 inches) long and 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) deep, but there was no serious facial nerve damage, said Dr. Jung Nam-shik of the Yonsei Severance Hospital. Lippert also suffered five cuts in his left arm and hand, but was not expected to have permanent damage to his arm function. Police said Kim stabbed Lippert with a 10-inch knife because he opposed the joint South Korean-U.S. military drills, which happen every year and frequently draw the ire of North Korea. Police official Yoon Myeong-seong told reporters that Kim had visited North Korea seven times between 1999 and 2007, and that authorities were investigating a possible connection between his visits to the reclusive state and the attack against Lippert.

"News: The common ancestor of humans may have had tentacles, a scientist has claimed. Organisms that lived in the sea 635 to 541 million years ago, from which humans and other animals evolved, likely had flexible appendages and a complex nervous system. It seemingly puts to bed another theory that suggests our ancestors were much more simple, worm-like creatures. A Russian scientist says the distant ancestor of humans had tentacles. One such creature can be seen at the centre of this illustration. They lived more than 540 million years ago and used them for food. It's likely they also had a complex nervous system like we do today . The latest research was conducted by Dr Elena Temereva from the Department of Invertebrate Zoology at the Faculty of Biology of the Lomonosov Moscow State University. Today, humans and many other organisms are bilaterally symmetric - we have a clearly discernible top and bottom, and a left and a right. However, our distant ancestors hundreds of millions ago were not, with many of them thought to be worm-like creatures that swam in the seas or walked on the seafloor. A warming climate may have enabled the earliest humans to venture into Western Europe 1.4 million years ago, a new study suggests. Researchers believe that the spread of our distant human ancestors, the hominins, had been halted by colder and drier temperatures. But as conditions warmed, they were able to branch out from Africa into Spain, and ultimately spread across Europe. The research.

"News: Almost 20,000 years ago a woman was buried deep within a cave on the Iberian peninsula, stained in sparkling red paint and adorned in yellow flowers. Her grave provides the first evidence of an ancient Magdalenian burial in the region and an engraved stone found near her remains appears to have been a makeshift tombstone. But the reasons why the female - dubbed 'The Red Lady of El Mirón' - was buried in such an elaborate tomb, close to an area where her peers would have lived day-to-day, continues to baffle archaeologists. The Red Lady's remains (burial site pictured) were found in the El Mirón Cave in Cantabria, Spain. Radiocarbon dating suggests she was buried 18,700 years ago. When the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material, later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal . During the Upper Paleolithic period the Magdalenian culture occupied much of western Europe and spanned from as early as 10,000 BC. Magdalenian hunters lived in caves, but sites have been found that consisted of shelters made from bones and animals skins. The Red Lady's remains were first uncovered in 2010 during excavations of such a cave called El Mirón Cave in Cantabria between Santander and Bilbao. After discovering a range of individual bones, researchers from the University of New Mexico led by Lawrence Straus, unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave. The Red Lady's remains were.

"News: They’ve won seven on the spin in the Premier League and made Liverpool look like relegation candidates as opposed to Champions League rivals during Saturday’s first-half slaughter. So why are Arsenal destined to sign off from another campaign celebrating a top-four finish and not a serious title challenge? Finish second they may well, but never have they entered the race for the top-flight crown. This term they are simply the best of the ragged rest, each with their flaws which have made the title tussle something of a ‘no contest’.

This is the most impressive team the Gunners have boasted since the dying embers of the Invincibles side of more than a decade ago. They have pace, power, energy and invention in attack – and that is just Alexis Sanchez. At the other end they have hit upon an understanding which has seen them not concede more than once in the league since New Year’s Day. But their failure to marry all of those components over the course of an entire campaign has cost them, again. This year, however, is a reverse of previous seasons.

"News: Andreas Lubitz appears to have researched suicide methods, cockpit door security and medical treatment before crashing the Germanwings plane into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board . Killer pilot Andreas Lubitz researched suicide methods and cockpit door security before crashing his Germanwings plane into the French Alps, it emerged last night. German prosecutors said an examination of a tablet computer found at his apartment revealed he had recently used internet search terms such as cockpit doors and their security, and suicide methods. The revelations came hours after it was reported that Lubitz told doctors he was on sick leave rather than flying. It also emerged that the 27-year-old was prescribed an anti-anxiety drug so strong doctors have to warn patients of the increased risk of suicide. People who use Lorazapam are advised not to drive a car, let alone fly a commercial jetliner. Medical experts say it can also increase the risk of self-harm at the start of treatment. Prosecutors yesterday announced that the second black box from the flight had been found. It was said to be in a good condition and was likely to yield more information. Investigators believe Lubitz locked his captain out of the A320’s cockpit on March 24 and deliberately crashed the plane, killing all 150 people on board – possibly because of suicidal tendencies or fears he may lose his pilot’s licence. Citing sources from the investigation, German newspaper Bild reported that he sometimes lied to doctors that he was off. Reasoning: The text details Andreas Lubitz's pre-crash research on suicide methods and cockpit security, his prescription of Lorazepam (a high-risk medication), and his deliberate locking of the cockpit to crash the Germanwings plane.

"News: The Kevin Pietersen camp have scored a comprehensive win in the PR battle with the England and Wales Cricket Board without calling on any outside assistance. It has been assumed that the way KP outplayed the ECB's army of media personnel at every turn was because his agents, Mission Sports Management, had expert help guiding their strategy. But agent Adam Wheatley, co-founder of the company with Sir Ian Botham, insists that everything has been done in-house since the brief involvement of former Sun editor David Yelland during KP's supposed reintegration into the England team in 2012. Kevin Pietersen scored 170 for Surrey in The Parks as he bids to earn a recall to the England squad . Wheatley said: 'We have just sat down together as a team with Kevin and planned the best way forward. It does help on social media that KP has a Twitter following of nearly 2.5million. 'And the ECB have totally misread the situation. You can't just keep briefing against someone. There are always two sides to a story and I think people now realise this.' Wheatley, once on the same Grimsby Town board as new ECB chairman Colin Graves, added: 'Colin's words about KP's future England chances have been interpreted in different ways but we believe there's a clean slate.'

"News: (CNN)Robert Boardwine's path to fatherhood was unconventional, but Virginia's appeals court said Tuesday he is legally entitled to be a part of his son's life. Boardwine's friend, Joyce Bruce, had used his sperm and a turkey baster to get pregnant. She thought after she learned she was with child that they should just be friends. She also thought that because they never had sex, she was entitled to be the boy's sole parent, according to court documents. The Court of Appeals of Virginia decided differently in weighing the commonwealth's assisted conception statute and denying Bruce's appeal to deny Boardwine visitation. It agreed with a circuit court ruling that method of insemination didn't come from medical technology. ""The plain meaning of the term 'medical technology' does not encompass a kitchen implement such as a turkey baster,"" the appeals court wrote in its decision. Bruce's attorney, Monica T. Monday, said she would need to talk to her client before she can comment about whether they will file an appeal. Boardwine initially was hesitant when Bruce approached him in 2010 with the turkey baster idea, the court document says. They talked about writing their agreement down on paper, but that never happened. They tried the turkey baster method a few times. He'd come over to her house, go to a room alone, bring his sperm in a plastic cup, they'd chat, and he'd leave. Then she'd use the kitchen utensil and wait. After she didn't get pregnant, she twice tried a fertility doctor..

"News: From the moment Jack Johnson beat Tommy Burns to win the world heavyweight title in 1908, a frenzied search began. While Johnson's victory wouldn't raise an eyebrow nowadays, it caused consternation in America for one simple reason: Johnson was black — and a black man had never held sport's greatest prize. Racism was rife in America: black people were not supposed to rule over whites in any sphere of life. As the great boxing pundit Bert Sugar put it, 'This was the white man's crown. (To white America), it was as if the white man's slave had become his master.' After beating Tommy Burns in 1908, Jack Johnson became the first ever black world heavyweight champion . It is difficult to convey to a reader in 2015 the shockwaves that Johnson's victory caused. Even liberal newspapers, such as The New York Times, were openly hostile to the giant Texan. It mattered little that Johnson was American. His skin was deemed the wrong colour and a great cry went up from white America to find a white challenger — a 'Great White Hope' — who could unseat the new champion. But little did white America know that it would take over six years before Johnson would be defeated, on April 5, 1915, 100 years ago on Sunday. Most had believed Johnson would be dispatched quickly. However, he made short work of his first four title defences, his most notable victory coming over world middleweight champion Stanley Ketchel who made the massive. Reasoning: The text details Jack Johnson's historic 1908 victory as the first Black world heavyweight champion, sparking intense racial backlash in 1900s America. It highlights his struggles against systemic racism, including the ""Great White Hope"" challenge from James Jeffries, his 1910 defeat of Jeffries, and the violent backlash from white Americans. Johnson's life was further complicated by legal issues, exile, and a controversial 1915 fight against Jess Willard, where Willard won despite claims of foul play. The text underscores Johnson's resilience as a trailblazer and the enduring racial tensions of his era, culminating in his death in 1946. Key events include his 1915 defeat, the 1944 confrontation with Willard, and the legacy of his career as a symbol of racial injustice..","After beating Tommy Burns in 1908, Jack Johnson became the first ever black world heavyweight champion . He held the belt for six years and Sunday will mark the 100 year anniversary of his last title defence . During a particularly racist period of American history, Johnson's title reign was met with many protests . Johnson was eventually defeated by Jess Willard in 1915, following 26 brutal rounds in the sweltering heat of Cuba ."

"News: Catholic bishops in America have denounced Wolf Hall as a ‘prejudice-laden presentation of the past’ as the acclaimed BBC drama was broadcast in the U.S. for the first time. The review attacked the six-part series as ‘a work of fiction that adopts a narrow, revisionist and anti-Catholic point of view toward the religious turmoil of the Tudor period in which it’s set’.

But internet law experts say the company behind the letters will have a hard time following through on the threats because it is very difficult to prove who is legally responsible for the downloading.

But legals experts say even if you are hit with a legal threat there are several ways to defend the accusations, Fairfax Media reports. iiNet's former chief regulatory officer, Steve Dalby, said the letter was not proof and it would be difficult for the film's studio to prove someone downloaded it. He said those hit with legal letters should also consider whether anyone else may have had access to their network.

"News: Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN)Kathmandu is a city with few good stories right now, but Tanka Maya Sitoula has one of them. The 40-year-old mother-of-four was at home when Saturday's deadly 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck, bringing the 5-story building down around her ground floor apartment. In the wake of the disaster, which has left at least 4,500 people dead across Nepal, Sitoula endured 36 long hours trapped in a room on the ground floor, before she was freed by an Indian rescue team. Remarkably, she escaped without injury, apparently protected by a beam. Sitoula, who talked to CNN through an interpreter, says she remained confident she would survive throughout her ordeal amid the rubble. ""I heard people making noise outside so I thought I would be rescued,"" she said, as she and her family sheltered in the grounds of a nearby school. ""I was confident that everybody was there outside and that I would be rescued."" What did she do for 36 hours? ""I was just lying down,"" she says. ""There was no room to move here and there.""

"News: Researchers found women judged to have pretty faces also have voices regarded by men as appealing (file picture) Men can judge how attractive a woman is by hearing her talk, according to a study. Researchers found women judged to have pretty faces also have voices regarded by men as appealing. ‘People can make quite reliable guesses about women’s facial attractiveness on the basis of their voices,’ said study co-author Markus Koppensteiner, an anthropologist from the University of Vienna. He added: ‘Attractive voices may create an idea about what a woman will look like.’ Researchers photographed the faces and recorded the voices of 42 women with an average age of 24. They then asked a group of men – with an average age of mid 20s – to rate the women’s voices on attractiveness and another group of similar age to judge the attractiveness of their faces. Those rated highly for looks often scored well for sound too, with the study finding a ‘significant relationship between males’ ratings of female faces and voices. Findings suggest that women with an attractive face also tend to have an attractive voice’. The scientists also mapped the shape, size and layout of the women’s faces to work out which facial traits were considered to be more attractive both physically and vocally. They found women deemed the most attractive tended to have ‘lifted jawbones, less robust jaws and fuller lips’. The research could shed light on the visual and vocal appeal of radio broadcasters such as.

I’m hoping that that wasn’t the whole point, as we’ve seen these sorts of situations engineered by agents before. The interview has almost certainly changed the way the fans feel about him.

The family was airlifted to hospitals in the United States. The boys, 16 and 14, were in critical condition at a Philadelphia hospital on Saturday, the family's lawyer, James Maron of Delaware, said.

"News: By the time he reached 17, there was no room for Geoff Johnson at home. His mother started compulsively hoarding when he was a young boy, refusing to trash anything; unable to fix anything. In his senior year, 1995, it was too much: he moved out. Now, two decades later, he and his younger sister Jennifer McShea have returned to the family home in Omaha, Nebraska - and nothing has changed. Geoff, 37, had visited his mother but only stood outside before picking her up to spend time elsewhere. Jennifer, also 37, returned just twice, on the advice of her counselor, to confront the deeply-embedded shame she felt. But when their mother passed away following a 12-year battle with breast cancer in 2013, the house was handed to them.

"News: It's normally Steffon Armitage who triggers it, but this time it is Nick Abendanon’s doing. He played so well for Clermont Auvergne last weekend – again – that England’s policy against picking players based abroad is back in focus. For the umpteenth time, the RFU and Stuart Lancaster are being urged to invoke the ‘exceptional circumstances’ get-out clause. There is an assumption in many quarters that, this being a World Cup year, it is time to abandon all principles and do whatever it takes to ensure that every Englishman, wherever he may be, is available for selection. Well, here’s an alternative suggestion. Scrap the clause. Now. It is proving to be more hassle than it is worth. Lancaster, his assistants and his employers are being stalked by calls for Armitage to be called into the national squad, as befitting his supreme exploits for Toulon. But that is to ignore the coaches’ reservations, and the realisation that the fall-out from a shift in policy would have long-term repercussions. Former Bath full back Nick Abendanon was outstanding for Clermont as they tore Saracens to shreds . Toulon flanker Steffon Armitage has been one of the standout forwards in Europe in recent seasons . Harlequins director of rugby Conor O'Shea believes the 'exceptional' clause could cause major problems .

Reasoning: The text discusses the controversy around England's ""exceptional circumstances"" clause for selecting overseas rugby players, with Nick Abendanon's strong performance for Clermont sparking calls to scrap the policy. It highlights conflicting views: some argue for flexibility during the World Cup, while others warn of long-term team instability. The article also touches on Sam Burgess's transition to rugby union, French stadium atmospheres, and player injuries, but the central debate revolves around the clause's impact on national team strategy and player loyalty..",Nick Abendanon was sublime in Clermont's 37-5 win against Northampton .

"News: A family has been awarded $150 million by a jury after a four-year-old boy was killed when Jeep Grand Cherokee exploded into flames three years ago. Jurors in Decatur County, Georgia ruled on Thursday that the SUV manufacturer, Chrysler, acted with reckless disregard for human life in selling the family of Remington 'Remi' Walden a 1999 Jeep with a gas tank mounted behind the rear axle. Walden, of Bainbridge, Georgia, was killed when the Jeep driven by his aunt was hit from behind by a pickup truck in March 2012. Remington 'Remi' Walden, four, was killed three years ago when his family's Jeep Grand Cherokee exploded when it was rear-ended . This March 6, 2012 photo shows the scene of a crash in Bainbridge, Georgia, where four-year-old Remi Walden was burned and died when a Jeep Grand Cherokee was struck from the rear by a Dodge Dakota pickup truck . The fuel tank leaked, engulfing the Jeep in flames and killing the four-year-old. The verdict came nearly two years after Chrysler compromised with a federal safety agency and agreed to a scaled-down recall of some older-model Jeeps with the rear-mounted tanks. The tanks have little structure to protect them if struck from behind, making them susceptible to punctures and fires. Federal documents show that at least 75 people have died in post-crash fires because of the rear-mounted fuel tanks. The jury of 11 women and one man, ruled after a nine-day trial that Chrysler was 99 per cent at fault. Reasoning: The text details a $150 million jury award to a family whose four-year-old son died in a 2012 Jeep fire caused by a rear-mounted gas tank. Chrysler was found 99% at fault for selling a dangerous vehicle, despite a 2013 recall. The case highlights safety concerns over rear-mounted tanks, with parallels to other high-profile auto lawsuits. Chrysler plans to appeal, while safety advocates criticize the recall as insufficient.

In fact, Harris was running fast and his arms were pumping very much like a man who is not protecting a gun in his waistband. What was Bates, an insurance company CEO, doing there in the first place? It certainly looks like Bates was given special access to ""real"" policing. Harris had given $2,500 to Sheriff Stanley Glanz's re-election campaign. He. Reasoning: The article details the incident where Robert Bates, a 73-year-old reserve deputy sheriff in Tulsa, accidentally killed Eric Harris during a police operation, mistaking a gun for a Taser. Bates, who had a history of involvement with the violent crimes task force and community activities, was given special access to law enforcement due to his donations to the sheriff's office. The incident raises concerns about the ethical and practical risks of volunteer police programs, where individuals with financial ties to law enforcement may gain undue influence. The article also critiques the broader issue of balancing volunteer roles with professional policing, emphasizing the need for accountability while acknowledging the value of community engagement in law enforcement..","Peter Moskos: Reserve cop, 73, meant to use a Taser on a man, but shot him dead instead. Why was a volunteer cop witha gun in a violent crimes unit? He says the man may have bought his way in with donations to police.

"News: As this image gets larger, what do you see? Most people will pick out a phantom-like picture of Albert Einstein. But if you see a Hollywood pin-up, you may need a trip to the opticians. At normal viewing distance, healthy eyes should be able to pick up the fine lines on Einstein's face, causing the brain to disregard Marilyn Monroe's image altogether. Scroll down for video . The image was created by superimposing a blurry picture of Monroe over a picture of Albert Einstein drawn in fine lines. Features with a high spatial frequency (Einstein) are only visible when you're viewing them close up, and those with low spatial frequencies (Monroe) are only visible from further away. Combining pictures of the two produces a single image which changes when the viewer moves closer or farther away from the screen. This classic optical illusion was created several years ago by neuroscientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In a recent video, AsapScience highlighted the process behind the trick, which can also be seen in a still image by anyone if they move closer and then farther away from the screen. ‘Depending on how well you’re able to focus or pick up contrast your eye will only pick out details,’ the video explains. ‘Up close, we’re generally able to pick up fine details like Einstein’s moustache and wrinkles. ‘But as the distance increases, or if your vision is poor and creates a more blurred image in the first place, your ability to.

The state trooper stopped the bus carrying Nelly and five other people on Interstate 40 in Putnam County on Saturday because it wasn't displaying U.S. Department of Transportation and International Fuel Tax Association stickers, according to Tennessee authorities. The trooper was about to conduct an inspection of the bus, a Prevost motor coach, when he ""noticed an odor of marijuana emitting from the vehicle,"" authorities said in a statement. Two troopers then searched the bus, finding ""five colored crystal-type rocks that tested positive for methamphetamine, as well as a small amount of marijuana and other drug paraphernalia,"" the statement said. The search also turned up several handguns and 100 small Ziploc bags, which the statement said are commonly used for selling drugs. The guns included a gold-plated .50-caliber Desert Eagle pistol, a .45-caliber Taurus pistol and a .500 Smith & Wesson magnum.

"News: Energy drinks like Red Bull are causing children to behave badly, a teaching union has claimed . Pupils’ excessive consumption of energy drinks is fuelling deteriorating behaviour, it has been claimed. Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, likened the caffeinated refreshments to ‘readily available legal highs’.

Miss Keates said: ‘This is the first time we have seen a significant number of teachers beginning to raise this as a concern. ‘These drinks are becoming increasingly popular among young people and are often seen as simply like any other soft drink, but many young people and their parents are not aware of the very high levels of stimulants that these drinks contain.’ She added: ‘Teachers are growing increasingly concerned that some young people are using these drinks to enable them to stay up into the early hours of the morning and then replace their lost energy by drinking two or three cans of these drinks on their way to school. ‘Teachers are reporting.

Reiner Mangold, head of sustainable product development at Audi, said: 'In developing Audi e-diesel we are promoting another fuel based on carbon dioxide that will allow long‑distance mobility with virtually no impact on the climate.

"News: (CNN)Washington. New York. Philadelphia. Havana? The Vatican says Pope Francis may add another leg to his trip to the United States this September, visiting Cuba just months after he helped negotiate a diplomatic thaw between the two nations. The possibility, which would add a dimension of international intrigue to an already highly anticipated trip, was first reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal. In response to reporters' questions, Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi said in a statement, ""The Holy Father has taken into consideration the idea of making a stop in Cuba"" on his way to or from the United States this September. ""However, contacts with the Cuban authorities are still in too early a phase for it to be possible to regard this as a firm decision or an operative plan,"" Lombardi continued. Francis, the first pontiff to hail from Latin America, played a key role in the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States, earning praise from both President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro. The Pope made personal pleas to Obama and Cuban leaders in private letters, writing that the two nations should try to reset their relations after decades of friction. The Vatican also hosted talks between U.S. and Cuban delegations in October, where they hashed out aspects of a new trade policy and discussed the release of jailed American contractor Alan Gross, who was freed as part of the detente between the two countries.

"News: These shocking pictures show a young bear being chained to a tree and attacked by dogs as part of a baiting competition to hone hunting skills in Yakutsk, eastern Russia. The controversial contest, held in the forests of the diamond-rich Sakha Republic, is celebrated in the region as a way of recognising the best canine bear hunter. Attacks by brown bears on humans are a danger in many parts of Russia, particularly at this time of the year as they awake hungry following the long winter hibernation. Brutal game: The picture shows a young bear chained to a tree while several dogs undergo 'hunting training' with the predator . Under attack: Masha, a five-year-old bear, can be seen attacked by a number of dogs as she is chained to the tree by her neck . Tradition: Once the dogs have found their way to Masha, they have to bark as loudly as they can with their cajoling scored out of 100 points . Many have to be killed when they encroach into built-up areas looking for food, often with dogs trained to stalk them in order for hunters to shoot them. But the images of the five-year-old chained up bear being attacked and bitten are likely to anger animal rights and anti-hunting groups in the West. In Russia, hunting of many kinds is a respected and mainstream activity and such contests as shown on these pictures raise few eyebrows. The pictures were taken by photo-journalist Spiridon Sleptsov during a visit. Reasoning: The text describes a controversial hunting competition in Yakutsk, Russia, where a bear named Masha is chained and attacked by dogs to train hunting skills. The event, held in the Sakha Republic, is scored based on the dogs' aggression and bites, with local acceptance of such practices. The bear, used for years, is described as seemingly enjoying the interactions, though the activity draws criticism from Western animal rights groups. The competition mimics real hunting scenarios, but the ethical concerns and risks to bears and humans are highlighted, especially with early bear awakenings due to warm weather. The photographer’s account emphasizes the dogs’ intensity and the event’s cultural roots in Russia..","Bear seen chained to a tree for baiting competition to hone dogs' hunting skills in eastern Russia .

Diet Pepsi will no longer contain the sweetener aspartame due to customer fears over its safety. The controversial sweetener has been linked to a range of health problems, although research has shown it to be safe.
