"Review: I love Capriotti but I don't love this location..every time I go there they say the oven is broken. They recommended me to go to there other location near Hard Rock Casino. Which I couldn't do because I had to ride a bus 35 mins to get there.it took at least 25 mins by bus to get to this location. Reasoning: While the reviewer expresses love for the Capriotti's brand itself (""I love Capriotti""), the experience at *this specific location* is consistently negative. The repeated oven issues and the inconvenient recommendation to travel a significant distance to another location clearly indicate dissatisfaction. The frustration is palpable.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I got a call from my girlfriend that her rental car had a flat so I told her to call Charlie Cheap Car & have them service it. Imagine my shock when they told her to put the spare on herself and call 2 days later because they were closed. When I finally got to Vegas a week later she still had the spare on & when we tried to return the car on a Monday, President's Day, they said no because again they were closed. What type of human tells a woman, much less a paying customer to do. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer expresses shock, frustration, and anger regarding the car rental company's inadequate service, specifically highlighting the instruction for the girlfriend to change the tire herself and the repeated closures preventing service. The strong language (""What type of human,"" ""POS,"" ""tell them they suck"") and the overall tone of disappointment leave no doubt about the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Typical Cap's right next to my place so it's convenient. The staff are actually nice...shocking I know!. Reasoning: While the review starts with a neutral observation about convenience (""Typical...so it's convenient""), the phrase ""The staff are actually nice...shocking I know!"" indicates a positive surprise and suggests a generally favorable experience. The ""shocking"" implies a previous expectation of something less positive, which is now overturned. This overall tone leans towards a positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Best vegetarian \""meat\"" sandwiches I've had out. Got a veg cheesesteak (morning star chicken shreds) and a turkey and slaw (sliced smoked soy based turkey of some sort). Fan. Tas. Tic. Good bread, good portions, great veg meat, polite staff...I wish there was one of these near my home town. I would eat here every night. $13 for a 20\"" sub just can't be beat.. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""Best vegetarian 'meat' sandwiches,"" ""Good bread, good portions, great veg meat,"" ""polite staff,"" and ""can't be beat"" clearly express a very favorable opinion. The reviewer's desire to eat there ""every night"" further emphasizes their positive experience. There are no negative comments or criticisms present.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I love this place! I get all of my uniforms for bartending here. They will give you a discount if you tell them you work in the casinos. \n\nThe only flaw is that they assume that every girl that comes in is a dancer. That is seriously annoying. Just because you THINK I am a dancer, doesnt give you the right to say it aloud. That is just RUDE.. Reasoning: The review expresses a generally positive sentiment due to the enthusiastic opening (""I love this place!"") and the benefit of discounts. However, a significant portion of the review details a negative and frustrating experience with the staff’s assumptions and rude behavior. While the positive aspects are present, the negative comment significantly detracts from the overall experience. The reviewer's frustration is palpable.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Read the reviews and was pretty pleased.....until I got to this Salvation Army. Major disappointment :/ \nThere is a mix of really old clothes & old shoes, really old worn out furniture, and dishes. I'm not expecting pristine items, but c'mon now these things should be given away to people in need, not charging them! I was at least hoping to find anything older vegas style, anything!!!! Found not a single item.....Oh well, on to the next shop. \nPlenty of parking thou. Reasoning: The review expresses significant disappointment (""Major disappointment :/""). While acknowledging the reviewer understood the items wouldn't be pristine, the core complaint revolves around the poor quality of goods being sold at a price, rather than given away to those in need. The phrase ""c'mon now"" and the overall frustrated tone clearly indicate a negative experience. The positive mention of parking is a minor detail overshadowed by the pervasive negativity.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Just a tip for everyone, this Macy's only sells home products, it does NOT sell any clothes whatsoever even though the yelp description says this location does - it does not. I drove to Macy's today to get a suit and this one was the closest to my house. I arrived and noticed that the sign is brown instead of the traditional red and it just looked different from the outside. I walked into the store and all around the store just to confirm that they do not sell any clothes. All they sell is furniture, towels, kitchen items, etc....\n\nIf. Reasoning: The review expresses frustration and disappointment. The reviewer went to the Macy's specifically for clothes based on the Yelp description, wasted time and gas, and highlights a misleading listing. While the language isn't overtly aggressive, the tone is negative due to the inconvenience and inaccurate information.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: The best!!\n\nWe had a thee hour flight delay - no problem! They called from the baggage claim area within 5 minutes of us landing letting my group know there were there. We were greeted by a man in a tux who helped with our bags and walked us out to the air-conditioned limo. We lucked out and got an automatic upgrade since our flight time was messed up so we got the big mac daddy of limos! It was so fun and they had chilled champagne ready to go for us. \n\nOnce we left the airport we turned on the. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses enthusiastic language (""The best!!"", ""so fun,"" ""made us feel like queens""), expresses gratitude for excellent service (prompt communication, tuxedo-clad greeter, helpful drivers), and highlights positive experiences (limo upgrade, chilled champagne, enjoyable ride). The minor inconvenience of the flight delay is framed positively, and the affordability is also a plus. The specific mentions of drivers Christopher and David further emphasize the positive experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I found these guys on the web and thought that, for our guys week out in Vegas, I'd get a limo to pick us up and drop us off. I used one of their web specials, made the reservation for a 7:15 PM pickup, and thought I was good. \n\nTwo of us were coming from Chicago and our third was coming from Des Moines. Our flight landed at 6:15 PM and the third landed at 7:10. I decided to make the reservation for 7:15 PM for pickup, in time for our third to be there when the limo arrived. \n\nUpon. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. While the return trip was described as uneventful and the driver polite, the core experience was riddled with problems. The reviewer details a significant issue with the company's unexpected policy regarding pickup times, the rude and unapologetic behavior of a manager (""Monique""), and being forced to pay an unexpected fee. The concluding recommendation to ""steer clear"" and avoid the company solidifies the negative sentiment. The language used (""mean, rude,"" ""treat their customers like idiots"") is strongly indicative of a negative experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I wish I could give a better review, but I wasn't completely satisfied. When I booked the limo, I specified that the sedan town car was what I wanted. The driver showed up in an SUV instead. I was never told there was a possibility I could get an entirely different vehicle. Also, there was no passenger seat - I had mentioned that I wanted one. Finally, the person booking the reservation asked me if I would like the driver to hold up a sign with the last name of our party. SInce it was a wedding, I thought it. Reasoning: The review expresses significant disappointment and frustration. While the reviewer initially wishes they could give a better review, the body of the text details multiple failures to meet expectations – incorrect vehicle type, lack of a passenger seat, and failure to provide the promised signage. The concluding question (""Why does Presidential offer it if they won't fulfill the request?"") further emphasizes the negative experience and lack of trust. This indicates a clear negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Presidential Limousines was good, but I had hoped for better. We had a pickup at McCarran Airport, and rented the limo for an hour assuming that would be enough time for the 20 minute drive. I was told on the phone that pickup time started when the plane landed. That should have been a warning! Our plane landed at 9:12 pm. The driver met us at baggage claim. I wanted to stop at a quick stop store (if we had time) she told me right then we didn't have time. I said okay, could we add an 1/2 hour to. Reasoning: While the review starts with ""Presidential Limousines was good,"" the overall tone is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer details a rushed, impersonal experience characterized by feeling like an inconvenience to the driver. Multiple specific negative points are highlighted: feeling rushed, the driver's apparent irritation, a lack of flexibility, and a general feeling of being treated as a transaction rather than a valued customer. The reviewer's advice at the end strongly suggests dissatisfaction and aims to prevent others from experiencing the same issues.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: This is a much delayed review. I got married in April 2014 and since it was just a simple ceremony with family members and a few closed friends, I didn't plan on getting a bouquet. My husband told me that I should get one so I have something in my hands. I went in to the shop around February, 2 months before to our big day, picked out a small calla lily bouquet and asked a specific ribbon color (tan in satin material) and was told it could be matched. The small bouquet which only has like a handful of. Reasoning: The review expresses significant disappointment and frustration. While the reviewer initially acknowledges paying a premium based on reputation, the core of the review focuses on a major discrepancy between what was ordered (tan satin ribbon) and what was delivered (dark brown ribbon). The language used conveys annoyance (""boy was I upset,"" ""not anywhere close,"" ""sucked it up"") and regret (""I wished I had gone and picked it up myself""). The concluding statement about requesting a trial for future flower purchases reinforces a lack of trust and a negative experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I go here to get my dog food and dog utilities. Staff is nice, if you run into them they will help. The store is always clean!. Reasoning: The review highlights positive aspects such as the helpfulness of the staff (""Staff is nice,"" ""will help"") and the cleanliness of the store (""always clean""). While the phrasing regarding staff interaction (""if you run into them"") suggests it's not always proactive, the overall tone focuses on favorable experiences.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Very good food but not a place to go if you are in a hurry. Habib is a very gracious host and explains the entire menu to you if you are a first timer. It is a very nice restaurant with classy decor. Definately a good place for a fancier dinner date or somewhere to go if you plan on having a conversation with your dinner companions. All of the reccomendations by Habib were wonderful dishes. I had the lamb and it was so moist and tender and the rice was a fantastic combination of spices and herbs like I've. Reasoning: The review expresses overwhelmingly positive sentiments. While the reviewer mentions the service is slower (""not a place to go if you are in a hurry""), this is presented as a trade-off for a positive experience. Numerous positive descriptors are used: ""very good food,"" ""gracious host,"" ""very nice restaurant,"" ""classy decor,"" ""wonderful dishes,"" ""moist and tender,"" ""fantastic combination,"" ""warm and fresh."" The concluding statement, ""definitely go back,"" seals the positive assessment. The only minor negative (""hummus was ok"") doesn't detract from the overall enthusiastic tone.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Four of us had a wonderful evening at Habib's. It was our first visit. The restaurant is lovely, and prices are reasonable for this quality of restaurant (table linens, a good wine list, appropriate stemware for quality wines, etc). This is not a jeans and t-shirt place. Understand that this is ethnic dining at its best, and the proprietor will be personally involved in your experience. He will visit your table often. He explains menu items and preparations in detail, so don't be afraid to ask.\n\nOthers have complimented the oven bread that comes out first with a little bowl of. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses words like ""wonderful,"" ""lovely,"" ""outstanding,"" ""perfect,"" and expresses feeling like a ""guest in his home."" They specifically highlight positive aspects of the food, the service (Mr. Habib's personal attention), and the ambiance. While one person in the party was initially unhappy, the prompt resolution by Mr. Habib further reinforces the positive experience. The enthusiastic closing statement ""We will be back"" is a strong indicator of satisfaction. The single negative comment is overshadowed by numerous positive comments and addressed effectively.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Truly an Authentic Chinese experience. It' looks like a Panda Express from the outside. Inside is a whole new story. Bunch of Chinese waiters running around. There's the infamous cliche of a fishtank. When we got here we were seated next to the fishtank. And fish were looking at me.....So I ordered one. Fried. With a black bean and spicy garlic sauce. Teach that fish to look at me....Grrrrr\nBut in reality. You can order chinese food on the menu. I like things off the menu that only the cool asians know. So my advice - learn some chinese food that's. Reasoning: While the review starts with some quirky and slightly odd observations (""fish were looking at me...So I ordered one""), the overall tone is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer explicitly calls it ""BEST CHINESE! EVER!"" and encourages others to seek out authentic, non-Americanized dishes. The initial quirks seem intended to be humorous and contribute to the unique, authentic experience they are praising. The enthusiasm in the update cements the positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Tried this place for lunch a few weeks back based on the Yelp reviews, and SOLELY on Yelp reviews as based on principal alone I don't think I'd ever randomly walk into a place called \""Food Express\"" Just on a whim I could come up with at least 515,129 better names (list coming soon!), but I digress....\n\nNot sure how others use Yelp but I like to type my address and then find the Highest Rated and \""Best Matches\"" within driving distance. This one kept coming up extremely high on the Best Match list. Sold.\n\nI then like to find the dishes. Reasoning: The review is complex and contains both positive and negative elements. The reviewer acknowledges the food was ""definitely tasty"" and praises the value for the amount of food received. However, they express disappointment (""slightly underwhelmed""), noting issues with greasiness, texture (""gristly""), and lack of freshness. The comparison to Applebees at the end further suggests it wasn't a particularly memorable or exceptional experience. The overall tone is somewhat critical but not overtly hostile. The humor and self-deprecating style (""Shut up."") prevent it from being purely negative.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: I love El Pollo Loco but this location SUCKS!! The guy in front of me was ordering catering and the girl was rude and said for him to hold on. She went to the back and came back up front taking crap about the girl she just went to the back to talk to. When we got up to the counter a new girl was taking our order. Her name was Cecy. She had her phone on the counter and was checking her Facebook as we were giving her our order. I caught her eye and gave her a \""seriously?\"". Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer expresses a general fondness for El Pollo Loco, the entire experience at this specific location was deeply unpleasant. They detail multiple instances of unprofessional behavior from staff (rudeness, gossiping, phone use during order taking), a missing menu item, and finally, the food itself being ""terrible"" and ""nasty."" The declaration ""I will never go back"" solidifies the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I went to this location yesterday and I was very disappointed. The lady at the drive thru was very rude.. Reasoning: The review explicitly states the writer was ""very disappointed"" and describes a negative interaction (""very rude"") with an employee. These are strong indicators of a negative experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I love Kelly Chiropractic. Not only do you feel very comfortable as soon as you walk in the door, I have never been to a chiropractor who is more thorough then him. He is an amazing Dr. An I recommend him to everyone. He has helped me tremendously with so many issues. I will never trust anyone else to work on me but him. Dr. Kelly an his wife Jane are amazing people. I know I am in good hands. So if you want the best chiropractor I suggest you see him.... Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses enthusiastic language like ""I love,"" ""amazing,"" ""tremendously,"" and ""best."" They explicitly recommend the chiropractor to everyone and express a strong sense of trust and comfort. The praise extends to Dr. Kelly's thoroughness and even his wife, highlighting a highly favorable overall experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Well, on my recent trip to Vegas and San Francisco, I made the drastic mistake of leaving both the battery and charger for my D7000 at home...in Chicago. \n\nI ended up checking out various, sorry excuses for camera shops on the strip which were price gouging like CRAZY. Most places were asking for $100 for an EN-EL15 battery and $70 for off brand chargers. \n\nEnded up here in desperation the day before setting off for the Grand Canyon. Thank God. Not the greatest deals on the planet (everything was MSRP), but I felt relieved knowing that these guys were charging. Reasoning: While the reviewer initially expresses significant frustration and describes negative experiences at other shops (""sorry excuses,"" ""price gouging like CRAZY,"" ""sharks""), the core of the review focuses on the relief and gratitude felt at finding this particular store. They explicitly state they felt relieved about the ""FAIR price"" and appreciated the kind service. The acknowledgment of MSRP and lack of comment on expertise are minor points compared to the overall feeling of rescue and positive interaction.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I LOVE THIS PLACE. My second review, yes--but I wanted to see if I could add a sixth star. Came back here three more times, and every single time the owner has come out and talked to me. He's such a great guy and totally boosts this place. GO GO GO.. Reasoning: The review uses extremely positive language (""I LOVE THIS PLACE,"" ""GO GO GO,"" ""great guy""). The reviewer's repeated visits and desire to award an additional star clearly indicate strong satisfaction. The personal interaction with the owner is highlighted as a significant positive.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: OMG... I found my favorite Korean/Hawaiian spot! \n\nService was awesome. Russell the owner was so friendly! He makes you feel like he appreciates your business. \n\nBetween the Hubby and I, we tried the combo plate (kalbi, BBQ chicken, meat Jun), hamburger steak, macaroni salad, mandoo, kim chee, daikon and bean sprouts. They were all outstanding. And Hubby likey very much. Kim chee never tasted so fresh and I don't even like bean sprouts. \n\nI cannot tell you enough how friendly Russell is. And who gives you extra mac salad? He does! I made sure he knew how much I appreciated. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses enthusiastic language (""OMG,"" ""awesome,"" ""outstanding,"" ""likey very much"") and expresses a strong sense of satisfaction with both the food and the service. Specific praise is given to the owner, Russell, highlighting his friendliness and generosity. The reviewer explicitly states it’s their “favorite” spot and intends to return soon. There are no negative comments whatsoever.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: If I could give this spot 100 stars, I would. I just moved to Vegas from Seattle and have been desperately seeking a new Hawaiian spot. This place is second to none. The flavors are amazing, the quality is superb, and the environment is SO warm and inviting. I'm a bit of a snob and was nervous looking from the outside in, but when I walked in I was pleasantly surprised to find a clean, nicely decorated restaurant. This place is AMAZING and if you try it you will be a happy as I am. The chicken katsu and kalbi. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""100 stars,"" ""second to none,"" ""amazing,"" ""superb,"" ""warm and inviting,"" ""pleasantly surprised,"" and ""best items"" clearly indicate a highly favorable experience. The reviewer expresses extreme satisfaction and enthusiasm.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: If I can give this place negative stars I would. Not so much for the food but the service. I used to go to this place with my Korean friends and family for naeng-myun and other Korean dishes. Today, there was this non-Korean, Hawaiian (I think) person working and was absolutely rude! I was short on time, had a 40 minutes lunch break and since Island- style was right across the stress, I was thinking 35 mins should be plenty of time to eat my food and leave. I was waiting over 20 mins for my food and I understand. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer mentions the Hawaiian plate lunch looked good and expresses a wish for the original owners to return, these are minor points overshadowed by a scathing critique of the service and food quality. The reviewer uses extremely strong language (""negative stars,"" ""rude,"" ""talk shit,"" ""dirty looks,"" ""tasteless""), details a frustrating and disrespectful interaction with an employee, and criticizes the authenticity and taste of the Korean dishes. The reviewer’s disappointment is palpable, and the overall tone is highly critical.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Ordered hot rock bi bim bap...tasty, but probably wouldn't order again. I'll try the bulgogi next time...or maybe the meat jun. Kimchi was delicious! Filled up on all the wonderful appetizers before I got my main dish. Ordered manju to go, but ended up eating half before i left as it was so tasty! Owners were welcoming and helpful. I did have to wait for a bit for service as they were so busy, bur it was worth the wait. Will eat there every trip to Vegas from now on. Probably one of the best hole in the wall, and. Reasoning: While the reviewer states they ""probably wouldn't order again"" regarding the bi bim bap, this is a minor point overshadowed by overwhelmingly positive comments. They explicitly praise the kimchi, appetizers, manju, and the owners. The willingness to return ""every trip to Vegas"" and the declaration of it being ""one of the best...restaurants"" are strong indicators of a positive experience. The mention of a wait is framed as worthwhile, demonstrating overall satisfaction.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Local love all the way! This place reminds me of home, Hawaii. I think we were served by the owner. He was extremely nice and told us he was from the Big Island.\n\nI've been craving meat jun and boiled peanuts and got a double score when this place had them both! All the appetizers were delicious especially the kim chee. The mandu was also really good. \n\nAfter we put in our order, the table next to us received hot stone dishes with eggs over easy. Our mouths watered at the sight, since they looked so good. \n\nThe meat jun meat. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses enthusiastic language like ""Local love,"" ""extremely nice,"" ""double score,"" ""delicious,"" and ""great flavor"" repeatedly. They explicitly state they would have rated it lower due to a minor authenticity concern with one dish but the excellent service ""bumped it back up to a 5."" The inclusion of ""Aloha"" at the end further reinforces the positive sentiment and creates a warm, friendly tone. While there's one specific critique (the Meat Jun not being perfectly authentic), it's presented constructively and doesn't detract from the overall positive experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I took my girlfriends Lexus in today.Right off the bat I notice that the here service is phenomenal, hands down, some of the friendliest dudes in the industry. The pricing was way cheaper than the rest and they didn't hike up the price after the service. Oh, and the timeliness was ridiculous! I was told I'd be there anywhere from 30 mins to an hour...20 minutes, BOOM, done!\nWhat Mexicans are to the moving industry, these guys are to the auto-mechanic world, excepts they all speak English.\nI'll definitely be back and recommend this place.\nBuen trabaj\u00f3 hombres!. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses superlatives like ""phenomenal,"" ""friendliest,"" and ""ridiculous!"" (in a positive way, referencing speed). They explicitly praise the pricing, timeliness, and overall service. The comparison to Mexicans in the moving industry (while potentially culturally insensitive, the intent seems to be highlighting exceptional skill and work ethic) further emphasizes the high regard the reviewer holds for the business. The closing statement (""Buen trabaj\u00f3 hombres!"") and intention to return solidify the positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: This is a good solid hobby store. Their stuff is not as complete as HobbyTown USA right across the street but is nonetheless worth a visit if you are in town.. Reasoning: The review uses positive language (""good,"" ""worth a visit""). While it acknowledges a competitor is ""more complete,"" it doesn't express dissatisfaction, only a factual observation. The overall tone suggests a favorable impression.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I took my son here to spend about $200 on a RC helicopter. There were a few other customers and I took a spot at the counter. I stood there for a few minutes while another lady was being helped. The associate behind the counter, an older gentleman with a huge food stain on his shirt, stood there while another gentleman helped the lady. This guy wouldn't even look me in the eye. After about 3 minutes I walked to another part of the store when my boy ran over and told me he had to go NOW!! \nAny parent. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer acknowledges a ""decent selection,"" the entire narrative focuses on extremely poor customer service. The details – the associate ignoring the customer, the dismissive response regarding the bathroom, the overall lack of acknowledgment or assistance – paint a picture of a frustrating and unpleasant experience. The concluding statement (""Don't waste your time...going out of business"") seals the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Horrible service. Went for a polish change on toes and nails, too 2.5 hours!! They don't have any gel colors that match normal polish like they said they do. Way understaffed too. Not good quality ether. But you get what you pay for I guess.. Very good prices.\n\nY ME NAILS. Y DID I CHOOSE TO GO THERE ALREADY CHIPPING. Reasoning: While the review mentions ""very good prices,"" the overwhelming tone is negative. The reviewer uses strong words like ""horrible,"" and expresses significant disappointment with the long wait time (2.5 hours), lack of expected products, understaffing, and poor quality. The final sentence about the already chipping nails seals the negative sentiment. The price point is the only vaguely positive aspect, but is presented as a justification for the poor quality, not a benefit.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: We used Larkin Plumbing years ago for a problem with our shower and were so pleased with their service. We called them again when we had the same problem in the other shower. Scheduling was a nightmare. We had an appointment, waited all afternoon to get a call that they couldn't get to us. Also, we asked them to call our cell but they kept calling our landline.\n\nWhen we finally got the plumber out he didn't have the part with him. My husband had described the problem. They had a record of our prior repair but didn't bother to bring. Reasoning: The review expresses significant frustration and dissatisfaction. While acknowledging past positive experiences (""so pleased with their service""), the reviewer details multiple negative issues: scheduling difficulties described as a ""nightmare,"" missed appointments, failure to bring necessary parts, unnecessary wait time, and a bill that was unexpectedly high. The concluding statement (""we will call another plumbing service"") definitively indicates a negative future outlook. The overwhelming tone is one of disappointment and feeling taken advantage of.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: They do not honor warranties in timely fashion. If you have a warranty claim they take a long time before they come and look at it. Unfortunately I can not wait that long as we need hot water.\nDO NOT USE LARKIN.\nTheir staff that answered the phone were also very unfriendly.. Reasoning: This review expresses significant frustration and disappointment. The reviewer explicitly states the business fails to honor warranties in a timely manner, describes an unacceptable delay, emphasizes a critical need that isn't being met, and concludes with a strong negative recommendation (""DO NOT USE LARKIN"") alongside a complaint about unfriendly staff. The language is highly critical and conveys a decidedly negative experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I love this place! The service is always great and friendly. Their milk teas, smoothies and drinks are all awesome. I usually get the honeydew smoothie with boba but lately , I have been addicted to the taro smoothie with boba. If you have not had the taro smoothie, believe me you will not get disappointed, never mind the weird purple color, this smoothie is refreshing and good. They also have appetizers in here but I have never tried it but it looks good. It is getting hotter so hopefully this place gets some serious business.:). Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""I love this place!"", ""always great and friendly,"" ""awesome,"" and ""believe me you will not get disappointed"" clearly indicate a very favorable opinion. Even the mention of a perceived negative (""weird purple color"") is immediately followed by a positive reassessment (""refreshing and good""). The overall tone is enthusiastic and supportive.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Volcano Tea House is one of my new favorite places to get boba drinks. It is located in Chinatown near a couple other shops but I personally prefer it due to the selection, the English menu and the nice, clear decor. \n\nThe only downside is that they only take cash, but drinks are $1+ cheaper then most other shops so I can deal with the cash only rule. . \n\nI decided to get a peach milk tea with boba rather then my normal honeydew milk tea, mainly because this was the first shop I saw that offered peach. It was. Reasoning: The review expresses overwhelmingly positive feelings. While the reviewer mentions a downside (cash only) and finds the peach milk tea a bit too sweet, these are presented as minor issues easily outweighed by the positives. They explicitly state it's ""one of my new favorite places,"" praise the selection, menu, and decor, and express optimism about finding the perfect drink with a small adjustment. The enthusiastic tone and overall positive assessment lead to a positive classification.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: THIS PLACE IS FLAT OUT, POINT BLANK, NO CONTEST, the best Bobba drink house in Nevada PERIOD! i have been drinking the black tapioca balls drink since i was 16 and now im 29 and i have had hundreds everywhere. Not only is it the cheapest place in town with a regular bobba being under 2.50 but the quality of the tea and the well prepared Bobba balls are cooked perfect. I really hate when people write comments like the balls were not cooked right when they had them in a frozen drink. When you have these cooked tapioca balls. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses emphatic language (""FLAT OUT,"" ""POINT BLANK,"" ""NO CONTEST,"" ""PERIOD!"") to express their strong approval. They explicitly state it’s the ""best"" boba shop in Nevada, and praise the price, quality of the tea, and the perfectly cooked boba. The detailed explanation and defense of proper boba preparation further emphasizes their enthusiasm. Even the mention of the cash-only policy is presented as a minor detail compared to the overall positive experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: This place lost everything because of \""Kim\"" working the register. Lose the attitude - smile or go home. There are places where the food - or tea in this case is mediocre but the service and staff are friendly - so you return. Neither were great! There are many choices out there - go try em!. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly negative. While it mentions the product (tea) being mediocre, the primary focus and strongest language is directed at the poor service and the employee ""Kim."" Phrases like ""lost everything because of,"" ""lose the attitude,"" and ""smile or go home"" demonstrate significant dissatisfaction and a strongly negative experience. The reviewer explicitly advises others to go elsewhere, solidifying the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: This is my favorite place to get boba. I usually order a taro milk tea or an avocado smoothing. I love how their reward system works by reserving 10% of your bill each time you come in. I just think they need to keep their dining area a little cleaner.. Reasoning: The review expresses a clear preference (""my favorite place"") and enjoyment of the products (""love how their reward system works""). While the reviewer mentions a minor issue with cleanliness, it's presented as a suggestion for improvement rather than a significant complaint. The overwhelmingly positive aspects outweigh the single critique.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: located in the chinatown plaza, this place is a good place for average drinks and food. the prices are a little bit more expensive than other places. the milk tea here is standard. the fruit drinks (such as honeydew and strawberry) are not very good at all.. go to the place inside the actual chinatown mall called no1 boba or something if you're craving a drink made of fruit (but scan your cup for hair or pieces of dirt before drinking.. that place uses fresh fruit but tends to lack on the cleanliness part). the green tea drinks are also. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative despite a few minor positives. While the reviewer acknowledges the location and appreciates the English-speaking staff, the vast majority of their comments highlight significant drawbacks. These include subpar drinks (specifically the fruit drinks and green tea), dirty surroundings, inconsistent and poor service marked by rudeness and argumentative behavior, and a general assessment of the establishment as ""mediocre."" The numerous criticisms outweigh any slight positives.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Wow, I guess this is the first homemade donut I've ever had? The cruller I had was light & airy but had an actual taste to it. Not just sugar and dough. This is a place that gives Vegas a hometown pulse. The owners seem very nice.\n The location itself is kind of easy to miss. It's an older strip mall and parking is weird. Just sort of be careful getting in and getting out of the place. Look for the big white best of banner out front.\n *IT'S CASH ONLY!!!. Reasoning: The review contains overwhelmingly positive language (""Wow,"" ""light & airy,"" ""actual taste to it,"" ""gives Vegas a hometown pulse,"" ""owners seem very nice""). While there are some drawbacks mentioned (location is easy to miss, weird parking, cash only), these are presented as practical notes rather than complaints that detract from the overall experience. The positive aspects significantly outweigh the negative.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Best Vegan donuts EVER!! I honestly make it a point to buy 2 dozen to bring back home to my friends just because you can't get donuts like these in So.Cal! I recommend Vegans and Non-Vegans check them out! Heck, I've made the three and a half hour drive just to buy them and come back!. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""Best Vegan donuts EVER!!"", ""honestly make it a point"", ""can't get donuts like these,"" and the willingness to drive a significant distance (""three and a half hour drive"") demonstrate extreme satisfaction and enthusiasm. The recommendation to both vegans and non-vegans further reinforces the positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: this place is amazing. if you are vegan, GET HERE. the donuts taste better than i remember. the glazed are obviously the best, but any of them will do. top two rows are vegan. if you are in las vegas DO NOT SKIP THIS PLACE!. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language (""amazing,"" ""GET HERE,"" ""best,"" ""DO NOT SKIP""). The reviewer strongly recommends the place, particularly for vegans, and expresses a clear enjoyment of the product. There are no negative comments or reservations expressed.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Not sure if it was a good idea OR a bad one that I stumbled on this place (speaking in the sense of weight/health wise!)\n\nI wasn't really sure if I understood what a vegan donut was and consisted of, but decided to swing here one afternoon. While they don't have a very varied selection, at the same time what they DO have suffices enough. Their plain donuts are 80 cents! I bought two of the plain ones, and let me say after eating those in little less than 10 minutes... I was hooked. Really bad.\n\nI've never tasted a donut that. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly positive despite the initial uncertainty expressed. The reviewer uses phrases like ""hooked,"" ""nothing like that,"" ""light, fluffy, and great,"" and compares the donuts favorably to those from major chains, emphasizing freshness and value. The humorous comparison to Homer Simpson further signals enthusiastic enjoyment. While the early closing time is mentioned as a drawback, it's a minor point compared to the strong positive descriptions of the donuts themselves and the overall experience. The reviewer also appreciates the vegan aspect and the affordability.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Finally got to try the vegan donuts that all the vegans in the world are raving about! \n\nOn this trip to Vegas, my bf and I flew so we didn't have cheap car transportation to the donut shop. Took the cab from Aria hotel to the donut shop, jumped out to get some donuts before they closed at 4pm, and then jumped back into the taxi to go straight to the airport. That whole cab ride cost us $35! Those were some expensive donuts, but I'm so glad I finally got to try the donuts.\n\nNot that the donuts are out. Reasoning: The review presents a mixed bag of experiences. While the reviewer expresses excitement about finally trying the vegan donuts (""so glad I finally got to try the donuts""), they also acknowledge the donuts weren't extraordinary (""Not that the donuts are out of this world...just like any other classic donut shop"") and point out some quality issues (cakey texture, dry apple burrito). The significant expense of the cab ride is also a negative element. However, the reviewer's enthusiasm, the free dozen doughnut holes, and the enjoyment of certain flavors (Boston Creme) ultimately create a generally positive impression. The humorous anecdote about. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: 3.5 rounded up. This is a basic bakery that charges cheap prices. I ordered the cruller, apple burrito, and a couple of donut holes. I thought all were good enough. I do prefer krispy kreme. Has a good following; the place had a steady stream of customers while i was there.. Reasoning: The review is mixed. The reviewer explicitly states items were ""good enough"" which is lukewarm praise. The mention of preferring Krispy Kreme indicates a lack of strong enthusiasm. However, the ""cheap prices"" and ""good following"" with a ""steady stream of customers"" are positive observations. Overall, the tone leans toward mild satisfaction rather than disappointment, but lacks strong positive language.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: Ronald's Donuts has been on my list of to try for about 3 years, but somehow I have never made it there. The stars were aligned recently, and we were in the neighborhood to drop by. So many to choose from, I was like a kid in a candy store. I managed to put my tongue back in my mouth and picked out a half dozen assortment of donuts. \n\nThe assortment was delicious. These were not skinny like your Krispy Kreme variety. These were fluffy pieces of dreaminess. [see picture]\n\nThe bonus is that it's locally owned, not a major giant,. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""like a kid in a candy store,"" ""delicious,"" ""fluffy pieces of dreaminess,"" and the enthusiastic ""Helloooo Ronald's Donuts!"" clearly indicate a very favorable experience. The comparison to Krispy Kreme is also used to highlight Ronald's Donuts' superior quality. The mention of kind and warm service further reinforces the positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Mmmmm finally had to check out what all the fuss was about with Ronald's donuts!\n\nOne morning I was in the mood for donuts and Ronald's is what popped in my head.\n\nI usually am not a sweet breakfast type of gal, however I was craving something sweet, soft and doughy so donuts it was!\n\nWe got a dozen, the most economic way to go and more than enough to split up between a few of us.\n\nThe donuts are fresh and guranteed good to satisfy anyone who may have a love for these deep fried sweet treats!\n\nWe liked them all and our dozen. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""finally had to check out,"" ""what all the fuss was about,"" ""soft and doughy,"" ""fresh and guaranteed good,"" and ""We liked them all"" clearly indicate enjoyment and satisfaction. The reviewer expresses a craving fulfilled and enthusiastically describes the donuts. There are no negative comments or criticisms.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Love supporting small businesses. You wouldn't even know the donuts were Vegan, they were that good!. Reasoning: The review explicitly states ""Love supporting small businesses"" and praises the donuts as ""that good,"" indicating a very positive experience. The surprise that they were vegan further highlights the enjoyment. There are no negative words or phrases present.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: This place is so freaking good. No way anyone can tell they vegan. The people who work here are always so nice. Cash only though.\n\nI flew in for my oldest daughters graduation, I had two food wishes while in town, Spam Musabi, and Vegan Donuts from Ronald's. I know, contradicting food forces pulling at me. ;)\n\nThe apple fritters are delicious, I carried them thru graduation then on plane, and now they are cleverly frozen and hidden at my fianc\u00e9s house in her freezer. \n\nSeriously, there is no way to tell the donuts are vegan, they are delicious. Just remember, CASH. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""so freaking good,"" ""delicious,"" ""incredibly nice,"" and ""a rarity"" strongly indicate a positive experience. While the mention of ""contradicting food forces"" is humorous and doesn't detract from the overall tone, the reviewer clearly loved the food and the service. The cash-only note is presented as a minor detail, not a complaint.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: yes. yes. YES!\ni'm in love w/ Ronalds and it may be a problem. their vegan donuts drew us in and became a quick favorite for my hubby & i. we always get a box of Ronalds before road-trips. amazing. my favorites are the boston creams & twists. yum!!!!!\ni also dig their cappuccino. just had some this morning! \nand always service w/ a smile :))). Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly enthusiastic. The repeated use of ""YES!"" and phrases like ""in love w/ Ronalds,"" ""quick favorite,"" and ""amazing"" clearly indicate a very positive experience. The reviewer expresses a strong preference and even plans to purchase the product regularly (""always get a box""). The smiley face also contributes to the positive tone.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: New batteries for my two Seiko watches was $10.75 each. I figure if I take in two watches for batteries, they would give me a break for length adjustment on my new watch which I bought somewhere else. \n\nI was wrong.\n\nThey charge me $10 for push out two pins out of my band and take out two links.\n\nTo change battery, you have to use new materials. \n\nIf I buy a new band there for $12, they have to do the same work and give me a \""new band\"" , and put it in for free.\n\nTo push two pins out, it. Reasoning: The review expresses significant disappointment and frustration. The reviewer felt misled about a potential discount and then felt unfairly charged for a simple band adjustment. Phrases like ""They crossed a line,"" ""It's BS,"" and the overall tone of the explanation strongly indicate a negative experience. While there’s mention of the battery cost being reasonable, the larger issue of perceived unfairness dominates the review.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I only went to this restaurant because island style was closed for remodeling. I have seen this place a couple of times and decided to give it a try. Im glad i did because now i know never to frequent this restaurant again. I don't care what this place looks like from the outside I'm strictly rating their food and service. First off my wife and i had to request the lunch menu, its not offered. The service was ok my problem was mainly with the food. Chinese food should be bold flavors with fresh vegetables and vibrant colors. This. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer mentions initially going because another restaurant was closed, the subsequent text focuses almost entirely on the poor quality of the food and service. Phrases like ""glad I know never to frequent this restaurant again,"" ""plain and boring,"" ""very bland,"" ""wasn't very good,"" ""don't care anymore,"" ""underwhelming experience,"" and the explicit statement that there was ""absolutely nothing good about the food"" demonstrate a strongly negative sentiment. The reviewer’s professional background as a chef further emphasizes their disappointment and critical assessment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Expect at least five flies flying around. Service has really gone downhill in the last year. Place is dirty and food quality is terrible. Previously they would offer their lunch special, now they try to push their regular menu on lunch patrons to make an extra buck. No longer one of my favorite Vegas restaurants. Never returning after last visit, lady owner was so rude. Eat at your own risk.. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The language used is extremely critical, citing numerous problems including unsanitary conditions (""flies flying around,"" ""dirty""), poor service (""gone downhill,"" ""rude""), declining food quality (""terrible""), and exploitative pricing practices. The reviewer explicitly states they will not return and advises others to ""eat at your own risk."" The totality of these negative points leaves no room for a positive interpretation.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: And yet another negative report.\n These guys, lemme tell ya...\nThe only reason why I even used this service was that they were across the street from my work place. They get the one star for convenience. \nBut the fellow there had me in line already and just because a couple of others had completed their service, he told me, \""Let me take care of these guys first.\"" \nI had come in for an oil change, and I asked if there was an extra charge for rotating tires. They said no. I asked them how long, they said maybe an hour.. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer uses phrases like ""negative report,"" ""I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy,"" and details a series of significant problems including excessive wait times, deceptive practices regarding service duration, prioritizing customers arbitrarily, and failing to deliver a promised service. The tone is frustrated and accusatory throughout.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: The Thai iced tea was very sweet. I don't mind this, but it may be too sweet for some. I ordered the koi soy (noodles in a curry soup), one of my favorite Thai dishes. I found it to be a little bland, but still good. I ordered medium heat, but the curry in the koi soy was barely hot at all. I also ordered the crab fried rice, and was a little more pleased with it. The rice was light and fluffy, and not at all greasey. Again, the flavor was a little more bland than I prefer.\n\nBased on. Reasoning: The review presents a mixed bag of experiences. While there are some positive aspects mentioned (the crab fried rice being good, the rice being light and fluffy), they are consistently tempered by criticisms regarding sweetness, blandness, and lack of heat. The final summary explicitly states the restaurant is ""rather average"" and that the reviewer wouldn't actively seek it out. This indicates a lack of strong positive feeling, leaning towards a generally lukewarm experience.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: Went to Georges for a alignment on my truck. Turns out my tire was about to blow which discount tire some how missed. I was advised not to take my truck on the freeway let alone drive very far at all because of how bad my tire is/was. \n\nThanks to Georges Alignment and Brakes I was able to avoid what could of been a horrible accident. If I have questions regarding my tires now I will go to Georges Alignment and Brakes before I go to the Discount Tire shop on Blue Diamond rd since the assistant manager there some. Reasoning: This review expresses overwhelmingly positive sentiment. While it starts by mentioning a negative experience with Discount Tire, the core of the review praises Georges Alignment and Brakes. The reviewer explicitly states they avoided a potentially ""horrible accident"" thanks to Georges, highlights their concern for the customer's safety, and appreciates their refusal to charge for the inspection and helpful guidance. The strong language of gratitude and the direct comparison to a less helpful competitor clearly indicate a positive experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Quick Review: Great value in the late night menu, good, but expensive food at other times of the day.\n\nLong-Winded Review:\nWhen I grew up in Vegas in the 80's, there were only 1-2 Japanese restaurants in town, but they were very authentic ones that served food you could find in Tokyo. Fast forward 20 years and we have a Sushi restaurant on every corner. Teriyaki Chicken is served at Jack in the Box. You can get California Rolls at 7-11. There are hundreds of \""Japanese\"" restaurants out now, but they're as close to Japanese as Olive Garden is Italian. Osaka's menu. Reasoning: This review presents a complex and nuanced perspective. While the reviewer expresses concerns about the restaurant trying to be ""all things to all people"" and notes higher prices compared to competitors, they also acknowledge the quality justifies the cost and regularly return. The late-night menu is highlighted as a significant positive, offering exceptional value. The desserts are a mixed bag, with some being a good value and others not. Overall, the reviewer's frequent visits and positive comments about the late-night menu and quality outweigh the criticisms.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: We love Osaka!!! They have very fresh, delicious sushi and sashimi. \nThere are very few restaurants around that I could say that about. We've been there many times in the past 4 years and never been disappointed. As for the person complaining about the price, I understand that you want to have accurate information, however $40.00 per person is very average for a full dinner of sashimi and sushi. We've paid that much at any sushi restaurant we've ever been to. (even the gross ones) This place really does rock though!!!. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""We love Osaka!!!"", ""very fresh, delicious sushi and sashimi"", ""never been disappointed"", and ""This place really does rock though!!!"" clearly indicate a very favorable experience. The reviewer even defends the restaurant against a price complaint, reinforcing their positive assessment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I stopped writing reviews on Yelp because it was too time consuming, but after eating at this restaurant, I can't help but tell the world about our experience, one that I hope will make other people wary of coming here.\n\nWe arrived at Osaka on a typical Saturday afternoon (1pm-ish) and was shown a table in the back room (where the tables were larger). As we walked past the first room upon entering, I noticed that it was fairly empty but it didn't struck me as odd since there are so many restaurants to choose from in Las Vegas.\n\nWe sat down. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer initially expresses a reluctance to write reviews again, the entire body of the text details a series of issues: confusing menus, a hesitant waitress, a misrepresented omakase deal, subpar food quality (with some bites being outright unpleasant), unexpected charges, and a dismissive owner/manager who refused to acknowledge the miscommunication or offer any resolution. The final statement ""I would rank this as the worst sushi AND experience ever"" seals the negative assessment. The recommendation to avoid the restaurant and seek alternatives further reinforces the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Really fresh sake. Great rolls. Nice option to get a half or a full roll. Delicious lychee sake. Fast service. Amazing!. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Words like ""fresh,"" ""great,"" ""nice,"" ""delicious,"" ""fast,"" and ""amazing"" all convey a highly favorable impression. There are no negative comments or criticisms present.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I've been coming here my whole life. The zaru soba is good. The sushi used to be better. But I'll keep coming here because I have a place in heart for it.. Reasoning: While the reviewer acknowledges a decline in the sushi quality (""used to be better""), the overall tone is nostalgic and positive. The phrase ""I'll keep coming here because I have a place in my heart for it"" strongly indicates a positive sentiment and a willingness to overlook the negative aspect. The mention of the ""zaru soba is good"" also contributes to a favorable impression.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Another great experience at Osaka's!!! We decided to have our NYE dinner at the Sahara location. The food rocked, flavors were well balanced and there was plenty of left overs to bring home. I have never had a bad experience at this location or the Henderson location. The food always looks and taste fresh and amazing. The prices are always reasonable and you get the quality of high end food... I will make Osaka's a 2013 restaurant for sure... \n\nFYI, GET THE TEMPURA ICE CREAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""great experience,"" ""food rocked,"" ""well balanced,"" ""amazing,"" ""reasonable,"" and ""high-end"" clearly indicate a very favorable impression. The enthusiastic recommendation for the tempura ice cream, emphasized with multiple exclamation points, further solidifies the positive sentiment. The reviewer explicitly states they've *never* had a bad experience, which is a strong positive endorsement.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Hands down, the absolute BEST Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas! The best sushi I ever had! You can't beat this place. This is what all Japanese restaurants should be measured against. I love this place and can't wait for my next trip to Vegas to go here!. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""absolute BEST,"" ""best sushi I ever had,"" ""can't beat this place,"" and ""this is what all...should be measured against"" clearly indicate strong approval and enthusiasm. The reviewer explicitly states they ""love this place"" and are eagerly anticipating a return visit.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I went there last Sunday and men !!! really god sushi I think come back asap. Reasoning: Despite the grammatical errors and unusual phrasing (""men!!!"", ""god sushi""), the reviewer expresses strong positive feelings. Phrases like ""really god sushi"" and ""come back asap"" clearly indicate enjoyment and a desire to return. The enthusiasm outweighs the unconventional language.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I'm big on first impressions, so when friends said this place was good, we decided to check it out.\n\nOur waitress was very nice. The sushi was descent and the beer selection was great.\n\nHere's the bad: terribly slow service. It took over 30mins to make a simple roll. Luckily we dined with friends so we weren't in a hurry but we hardly saw our waitress. I shouldn't have to flag people down just to find out the status of an order. When she did finally return, she gave us our check. She never came back. Had to go to the counter. Reasoning: The review presents a mixed bag. While the reviewer praises the waitress's niceness, the beer selection, and the sushi being ""decent,"" the overwhelming tone is negative due to the extremely slow and inattentive service. The explicit statement ""I won't return"" and the comparison to other sushi restaurants strongly indicate a negative overall experience. The positive elements are overshadowed by the significant issues with service.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Honey walnut shrimp. I was craving some yesterday, so despite the negative reviews on here, I decided to stop by for lunch. Honey walnut shrimp is $11.95 and comes with a generous amount of shrimp and a side of white rice. The food took about 10 minutes so I know they made it fresh. I really enjoyed my food and I have nothing negative to say about this particular visit.. Reasoning: The reviewer explicitly states they ""really enjoyed"" their food and that they ""have nothing negative to say"" about the visit. While they acknowledge previous negative reviews, their personal experience was positive. This direct expression of enjoyment makes the sentiment overwhelmingly positive.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I have been going to Jimmy Johns Sandwich shop for 2 years now.I absolutely love there sandwiches and trust me Im a big fan. But today when I came in I was very disappointed. When I received my #9 I had ask the nice guy at the counter for 4 out of the hundereds that were in the giant box of packets of yellow mustard. He said he was only able to give me 2, 2 packets of yellow mustard for the giant sandwich I had in front of me was a joke. He said he would have to charge. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer initially states they ""absolutely love"" the sandwiches, the entire rest of the review focuses on a deeply frustrating and poorly handled interaction with the staff regarding mustard packets. The language used is highly charged with phrases like ""worst experience,"" ""absurd price,"" ""mustard natzi,"" and descriptions of the manager's demeanor that are very critical and accusatory. The reviewer’s rant far outweighs any positive sentiment initially expressed.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: This laundromat is a good price and has flat screen TVs, video games and a theater in the back. Regular prices. nice washing machines and dryers dried all my clothes for $0.75. Good atmosphere. will be going back. would recommend to friends and family. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""good price,"" ""nice washing machines,"" ""good atmosphere,"" ""will be going back,"" and ""would recommend"" all indicate a favorable experience. There are no negative comments or complaints present.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I just can't. This place is disgusting.\n\nI don't know why I do this to myself. But I figured just because I had ONE not so good experience doesn't mean I should ax them out of my food choices.\n\nNo. No. and No! This place must drench their food in grease. This time around, I ordered some garlic chicken dish that comes with \""red fried rice.\"" The garlic chicken tasted....\""off.\"" I can't really make out what the taste was but I definitely did NOT taste garlic. What's odd is that I tasted BAMBOO SHOOTS instead!!! Ummm...what!?!?!?! Why would someone put bamboo shoots. Reasoning: The review uses extremely negative language. Words like ""disgusting,"" ""failed,"" ""nasty,"" and phrases like ""Stay away from here,"" ""I would NOT eat their food"" clearly indicate a very poor experience and strong dissatisfaction. The reviewer expresses disbelief and disgust at the food's preparation and taste, highlighting multiple issues. There's no positive sentiment expressed anywhere in the text.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Food was good. I never had crepes so I wanted to try them. They were good but I'm not a fan of the cheese that they stuff them with. \n\nThe worst thing about our first visit was we were seated by the bathrooms. I will take the blame as I should have said when they were seating us that we would just sit at the bar. The place was very busy and they had the other side closed. I really don't appreciate being sat by the bathroom in any restaurant.\n\nWe will go back and give it another go. :). Reasoning: The review contains both positive and negative elements. The reviewer explicitly states the food (""Food was good,"" ""They were good"") was enjoyable. However, they express dislike for the cheese filling and a significant negative experience regarding the seating location (being seated by the bathrooms). The statement ""We will go back and give it another go"" suggests a willingness to try again, leaning towards a potentially positive outlook despite the initial negative. Overall, the mix of positive and negative, with the expressed intent to return, suggests a mildly positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Came here with the hubby & my kiddo today for lunch. I ordered the mexi combo plate so I could share with the little one. It came with a taco, burrito, quesadilla and rice/beans. It was fresh and filling but nothing to jump up about. Hubby had the grilled cheese & mashed potatoes. He loves that combo and was very happy with it even though it looked pretty lame to me. Our server was ok but we did get harassed as we were walking in by some homeless guy..get this..he told us to eat at Omelet House..LOL Weird.. Reasoning: The review expresses a generally lukewarm experience. While the food is described as ""fresh and filling,"" it's also noted as ""nothing to jump up about."" The husband's meal was ""pretty lame"" according to the reviewer. The server was merely ""ok."" The most significant negative aspect is the uncomfortable encounter with a homeless person, although this is presented with a humorous tone (""LOL""). Overall, the positive and negative elements balance each other out, leaning towards a slightly positive but largely unremarkable experience.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: Blueberry Hill Family restaurant Decatur has gone WAYYYY down hill, the food quality is atrocious, the prices absolutely outrageous, and the specials are never available when you want one. The last time we went it was at 6pm and they \""claimed\"" to be OUT of the special only an hour into their dinner service? Methinks not. Never again will we attempt to dine at this establishment.. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly negative language. Words like ""atrocious,"" ""outrageous,"" and phrases like ""gone WAYYYY down hill"" and ""never again"" clearly express strong dissatisfaction. The reviewer also questions the restaurant's honesty regarding the specials. There are no redeeming qualities mentioned.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I'm not much of a pancake person. To me, they're usually a little monotonous in taste and there's always a little too much for me to finish. I eat them last in big breakfast platters since I fizzle out halfway through. \n\nExcept for Blueberry Hill's Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes, I can eat them ALL DAY. They made me a fan all over again for pancakes! I felt like a kid again where I couldn't get enough of them! (However, I get the fresh fruit compote on the side - it's a little over-the-top for breakfast for me, very sweet and a. Reasoning: This is a complex review, and overall leans positive. The reviewer initially expresses a dislike for pancakes in general, which initially suggests a negative sentiment. However, their strong, enthusiastic praise for Blueberry Hill's pancakes (""I can eat them ALL DAY,"" ""made me a fan all over again"") significantly outweighs this initial negativity. They also compliment the french toast, the standard of the breakfast overall, and the service. While they note some drawbacks (compote being too sweet, bland marinara sauce, small water glasses), these are presented as minor inconveniences rather than dealbreakers. The enthusiasm for the pancakes and the generally positive. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Lived here for 7 years and been meaning to check this place out. Went on Wednesday AM, seated right away. Waitress was great transplanted New Yorker..\nOnly complaint was the blueberry muffin while large was scarce on the berries. Other than that, had eggs, ham and hashbrowns which were tasty.\nCoffee was good. Tasted some different than the water served most places. Service was excellent!. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive. While there's a minor complaint about the blueberry muffin (""scarce on the berries""), it's presented as a small issue. The reviewer explicitly praises the prompt seating, the waitress, the tasty eggs, ham, hashbrowns, good coffee, and excellent service. The positive aspects significantly outweigh the one small critique.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I really like this jack in the box, the people are always nice and the food is always hot! When I had to wait for my burger, I didn't order a drink i was standing near the register off to the side they handed me a free drink and thanked me for waiting.. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language (""really like,"" ""always nice,"" ""always hot""). It highlights positive interactions with staff and even describes a generous, unexpected act of kindness (the free drink). While there's a mention of waiting, the response to that inconvenience was exceptionally positive, further reinforcing the overall positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I always thought this was a smaller version of Sam's Club or Costco, intended for vendors to buy wholesale. This is located in the WalMart shopping center and on the 2 occassions I went there nothing was cheap. The stuff I was looking for cost more than going across the parking lot to Walmart and buying the same stuff in smaller quantities. Its a very small store which looks alot like Sams Club inside without having to be a member or whatever. They have wide aisles and cart at the ready but they just dont have much for less.. Reasoning: The review expresses disappointment and frustration. While the reviewer acknowledges some positive aspects (wide aisles, cart availability, resembling Sam's Club without membership), the core complaint is that prices are higher than Walmart's, negating the supposed benefit of wholesale buying. The phrases ""nothing was cheap"" and the overall tone of unmet expectations point to a negative experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Meh...some of the residents are dodgy and the apartments aren't that great, but you get what you pay for. I wish I had known the lay of the land a bit better before choosing this place. Great move in specials and the maintenance guys are pretty nice, but the office staff are condescending and generally unhelpful. I'd keep searching if you're considering Indian Hills.. Reasoning: The review contains a mix of positive and negative aspects, but the negative comments outweigh the positive. While acknowledging move-in specials and nice maintenance staff, the reviewer expresses concerns about the residents (""dodgy""), apartment quality, condescending office staff, and suggests potential renters should look elsewhere. The phrase ""I wish I had known"" and the ultimate recommendation to ""keep searching"" indicate dissatisfaction.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: YUCK! The Baka burrito was COLD! It had mole sauce instead of ranchero sauce and they just can't seem to find RIPE TOMATOES! Even though the meat was cold the bite or two I had the meat was pretty decent. Maybe Baja Fresh will get their act together. If you can do that I will be back. I won't patronize this establishment again until probably July. To be fair, they did refund my money for a second time in as many attempts.. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative despite the mention of a refund and the ""pretty decent"" meat. The reviewer uses strong negative language (""YUCK!""), expresses disappointment with multiple issues (cold food, incorrect sauce, unripe tomatoes), and explicitly states they won't return for several months. While acknowledging the refund, this is presented as a reactive measure to a problem rather than a positive experience. The overall tone conveys a very dissatisfied customer.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Best docs ever! Doc K is a leading expert in Pain Management and is fantastic! Doc Jarrett makes my back feel like a million bucks!! Doc K's schedule gets full pretty quick so make sure you get on the books for an appointment. Unfortunately his day doesn't have much \""wiggle room\"".. Reasoning: The review overwhelmingly uses positive language and expresses high praise for both doctors mentioned (""Best docs ever!"", ""fantastic!"", ""makes my back feel like a million bucks!!""). While the comment about Doc K's schedule being full and lacking ""wiggle room"" is a logistical observation and not inherently negative, it doesn’t detract from the enthusiastic endorsements of the doctors' expertise and care.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Kevin and Tammy seem super nice. Christine has a nasty attitude she does a horrible job. She does not know how to speak to costumers. She really is a b.tch. Tammy had to redo them. Never going back! .. Reasoning: The review contains overwhelmingly negative language. While there's a positive mention of Kevin and Tammy (""super nice""), this is immediately overshadowed by harsh criticism of Christine (""nasty attitude,"" ""horrible job,"" ""does not know how to speak to customers,"" and a highly offensive slur). The statement ""Tammy had to redo them"" further suggests a negative experience and the concluding ""Never going back!"" solidifies the negative overall impression. The intensity and directness of the negative comments outweigh the single positive comment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Was not happy with this place at all. Took my nephews, who are locals, for lunch here, and was sorely disappointed. I order the shrimp with sizzling rice, and got a very mediocre and slightly slimy concoction, but it did sizzle. \nWe ordered a pu pu platter, and it gets very mixed reviews. the beef sticks were good, the fried wonton tastless, and the ribs looks so dehydrated, we didn't even try them. \nThe sevice was worse than the food. First, they do not include steamed rice with their entrees, so we ordered 2, which never came even after we. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer uses phrases like ""was not happy,"" ""sorely disappointed,"" ""mediocre,"" ""tasteless,"" and ""dehydrated"" to describe the food. Furthermore, the service is heavily criticized with mentions of missing items, neglectful behavior, and inattentiveness. The concluding sentence strongly advises against visiting the establishment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Unfortunately the service here has dropped off in the past few years. Every family trip (about once annually now) we would come down to Chinatown to grab some good eats. In the past this restaurant was bustling full of people, service was quick, and portion/food was great.\n\nSeems the prices haven't changed too much but the food quality, portions, and slow service (with noone else in the restaurant) have dropped off. Some of the plates were okay, but most were bland, over-salted, or had enough oil to make a soup out of.. Reasoning: While the review acknowledges that the restaurant *used to be* good and mentions ""some plates were okay,"" the overwhelming tone is negative. The reviewer explicitly states the service has ""dropped off,"" the food quality and portions have declined, and describes food as ""bland, over-salted, or had enough oil to make a soup out of."" The nostalgic reference to how it *used to be* emphasizes the current disappointment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: *Review is strictly for the Taiwanese style breakfast*\n\nDo you know what's worse than losing money in Vegas? The answer is coming here for Taiwanese style breakfast ...\n\nI don't even know why I came here in the first place, but our group saw the word \""Yong He Soybean Milk\"" (\u6c38\u548c\u8c46\u6f3f) and the rest is history. \""Yong He Soybean Milk\"" symbolizes a famous Taiwanese breakfast restaurant and everyone nowadays just abuses its name. Breakfast is available from 8 AM to 2 PM.\n\nThere was only one server at 8 AM and he doesn't seem to speak English, but at least he speaks fluent. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer acknowledges the appeal of ""Yong He Soybean Milk"" as a name, the actual experience is criticized on multiple fronts: disappointing taste, high prices (especially for the wonton soup), poor service, and a dirty restroom. The repeated use of phrases like ""disappointing,"" ""tasteless,"" ""expensive,"" and the final statement describing the experience as something they ""want to forget"" clearly indicate a negative sentiment. The 1/5 and 2/5 ratings further emphasize this.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I hate writing one star reviews but this place is so awful that I need to warn those who are foodies like us.This should get a negative star if available.\n\nWe had a party of 18 and was so excited that they seated us so quickly. However we can not order because all of our group have not arrived. What the f@ck?????? Why seat me? We have 7 kids with us and they served us only their diluted tea. My sister asked for water for the kids at the beginning when seated....waiter shakes his head yes,yes..water for kids. \nFinally my Asian. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer uses extremely strong negative language (""awful,"" ""hate,"" ""nasty,"" ""$hit hole"") and expresses frustration and disappointment throughout the entire experience. They highlight multiple issues including slow service, refusal to serve water, overly salty food, a lack of glasses for water, and perceived rudeness from the staff. The repeated use of expletives and the final statement ""Never coming back"" solidify the deeply negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: One of the best stores and optometrists I have ever been to. The store is very clean and open, there is plenty of seating available while you wait, that is, even if you have to wait. The service is quick and if you have any questions, there is always an attendant to answer. Their pricing on their frames are very affordable, and their insurance policy is great, they accept all insurances and help you get through everything step by step.\n\nThe staff at Spring Mount Vision is astronomical, especially the doctor, one in particular. Dr. Kevin Diep one of the most. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""one of the best,"" ""astronomical"" (to describe the staff), ""very clean,"" ""quick service,"" ""affordable,"" ""great insurance policy,"" and ""polite doctor"" all indicate a highly favorable experience. The reviewer explicitly recommends the store and staff, solidifying the positive sentiment. There are no negative comments or complaints present.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: For those of you who are going to order Kung-Pao whatever and Cashew whatever, Fried Rice, Egg Foo Young, or Egg Rolls, then complain how it wasn't good, better not eat here. This is a Chinese Restaurant.\n\nI wouldn't go to a fine Mexican Restaurant and Order Nachos Bell Grande or Meximelts for dinner.\n\nWith that said, finding a good Chinese Restaurant in a desert would be challanging. I am writing this as a customer with lots of Chinese restaurants tested. \n\nThe ambience was conservative and they are open from 11am - 3am\nThe price was a bit higher, but not outrageous, but. Reasoning: This review presents a complex mix of observations. The initial paragraph is quite harsh, setting a negative tone by essentially telling people to avoid ordering certain dishes. However, the bulk of the review focuses on positive experiences – emphasizing the freshness of the seafood, the quality of the ingredients (fresh tomatoes instead of ketchup, good rice), and the excellent recommendations from the waiter. The reviewer explicitly states they would return, which is a strong indicator of a positive overall experience. The mention of higher prices and a wine list that isn’t quite right are minor criticisms. Considering the final statement. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: The service here was good but the portions for the price and the quality was not. Yes the food did taste good but nothing really stood out. I guess since I live near the san gabriel area im pretty much used to this type of food at a more reasonable price. Good dishes to get here are the black bean sauce clams, stir fried string beans, and fried salt and pepper sea bass. Parking is easy and the wait isn't long.. Reasoning: This review presents a mixed bag. While the reviewer explicitly states the service was ""good"" and highlights specific dishes they enjoyed (""black bean sauce clams,"" ""stir fried string beans,"" ""fried salt and pepper sea bass""), the core complaint revolves around value for money. They felt the portions were inadequate given the price and quality, and referenced a baseline of expectation based on living in the area. The phrase ""nothing really stood out"" also indicates a lack of exceptionalism. The positive aspects are tempered by the negative assessment of value, resulting in an overall lukewarm impression.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: I feel like lately I've only been reviewing places I didn't like so now I am going to pick a place I like and review it. I've been to Joyful House many times and it's pretty consistently good. My favorite thing to get here are the steamed oysters that you order individually. I rarely am able to find this dish anywhere else but it is just so amazing. Oysters steamed with black bean sauce and globs of garlic on top...How could that ever not be good?\n\nOther stuff I've had that were really good are: Sizzling Scallops with Black Bean Sauce. Reasoning: While the review mentions a disappointing dessert and a slightly pricey dish, the overwhelming tone is positive. The reviewer explicitly states they wanted to review a place they *liked* and repeatedly uses terms like ""amazing,"" ""divine,"" and ""consistently good"" to describe the food. The late operating hours are also presented as a positive attribute. The minor negative experiences are framed as isolated incidents rather than systemic problems.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Definitely love the half price lobster when they had the special. I ordered the lobster with thai chili sauce and it was to die for. I ordered the lobster fried with xo sauce before and it wasn't as good as the thai chili style. Honey walnut prawns were the best. Fried sea bass was fresh too. baby bok choi with garlic was a little greasy but perfect. Word of advice, take a chinese friend with you who knows how to order cuz the experience will b 10,000 times better.. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive. While there's a minor criticism about the baby bok choy being greasy, the reviewer uses highly enthusiastic language (""to die for,"" ""best,"" ""10,000 times better"") to describe several dishes, specifically highlighting the lobster and prawns. The suggestion to bring a friend who knows how to order further implies a positive overall impression of the restaurant's potential.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Been here a couple times but last week was the first in awhile. Figured it was time to write a review on this place now having visited it once again.\nMy mom loves this place. For this latest visit, it was a family affair. I don't know how weird this sounds. For I, upon walking into Joyful House, the ambiance feels like how I'm used to a chinese restaurant feeling like. I will admit the food is slightly pricier here. To be fair, the food is, for the most part, decent to very good. They do serve complimentary jasmine rice, which. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive despite acknowledging a few minor drawbacks. The reviewer explicitly states their mom loves the place, highlights the pleasant ambiance, praises the food as ""decent to very good,"" and appreciates the complimentary jasmine rice and hot tea. While they mention slightly higher prices and occasional service lags due to busyness, these are presented as relatively minor points. The 3.5-star rating reinforces the positive overall impression.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: If I was writing this review 2 years ago this place would have 5 stars without a doubt. The food in this place is really good and the service is also but they've gotten greedy. I've been coming here for years and we liked this place so much we'd come at least 2-3 times a week for lunch and other times for take out. I highly recommend the tenderloin beef in black pepper sauce with portabella mushrooms, their fried rice and spicy crispy shirmp.\n\nThe prices have been on increasing regularly and the amount of food has gone down drastically, not. Reasoning: While the reviewer expresses fondness for the food and service (""really good,"" ""liked this place so much""), the overwhelming sentiment revolves around negative changes – specifically, increasing prices and drastically reduced portion sizes. The reviewer’s disappointment is evident (""irritated me""), and the mention of nearby competition suggests a potential loss of business due to these changes. The initial praise is overshadowed by the current negative experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: My favorite bakery to visit when we are in Vegas. The prices are more affordable than other similar bakeries in the area, and they taste better than anyone else. \n\nMy favorite items are the milk bun (or it may be called a custard bun) and the egg tarts. The bread portion of their buns are really good. That's saying something cause I normally do not like bread at all. The egg tarts are very good!! Just wish, they'd make more. Many times when we go there, they've already sold out!!! When that happens, I'm really disappointed cause I look so. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""My favorite bakery,"" ""taste better than anyone else,"" ""very good!!,"" ""yummy,"" and a general enthusiastic tone consistently express a favorable opinion. While the reviewer expresses disappointment about items selling out, this is framed as a testament to the bakery's popularity and doesn't detract from the overall positive sentiment. The recommendation to ""Definitely, try this place"" solidifies the positive classification.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I came into the shop right when they opened to grab some pastries and pork buns for a quick breakfast. When I entered, there was no one attending. The cashier, or whoever, was in the back doing something so I couldn't ask questions. When the cashier finally came some out, she seemed like she woke up on the wrong side of the bed. I don't know if it was just me or what, but she was so rude. I asked to microwave the pork buns and so at first she didn't want to, then she took it and when she. Reasoning: The review contains a significant amount of negative sentiment primarily driven by the interaction with the cashier. The reviewer explicitly describes the cashier as rude, mentions being ""thrown"" food, and expresses disappointment with the interaction. While the pork buns were “okay” and the coconut macaroons were praised, the overwhelmingly negative experience with the staff heavily outweighs the positive aspects. The concluding statement ""I wouldn't really come back"" reinforces the overall negative impression.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: milk tea, fruit tea.. all good. we ordered snacks like peppered chicken and toast that were really good as well. Wanted to get their shaved ice with tapioca strips, but they were out unfortunately. This is my hang out spot almost every night while I was in Vegas!. Reasoning: The reviewer uses overwhelmingly positive language (""all good,"" ""really good"") and explicitly states it's their ""hang out spot almost every night."" While the disappointment about the shaved ice is mentioned, it's presented as a minor inconvenience and doesn't detract from the overall positive experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I was expecting more... better... I'm not sure why, but I was. We got a large coffee milk tea with boba and a large peppermint green tea with boba. Hubby liked his coffee milk tea but my peppermint green tea tasted like I had swallowed some spearmint gum. I thought it was supposed to be peppermint? In any case, almost $12 for the two seemed a little pricey. And what's with the attitudes? I felt like I was an inconvenience for asking to place an order. I think I'll go elsewhere for my Boba tea next time.. Reasoning: While the reviewer acknowledges one drink was enjoyed (""Hubby liked his coffee milk tea""), the review is overwhelmingly critical. The phrases ""I was expecting more,"" ""tasted like spearmint gum,"" ""felt like I was an inconvenience,"" and the explicit statement ""I think I'll go elsewhere"" all point towards a negative experience. The price point also contributes to the negative tone. The overall impression is disappointment and dissatisfaction.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I have made it a habit of stopping here for boba milk tea on my way home from a delicious meal at hot and juicy crawfish.\n\nThis place can get pretty crowded, but the to-go line is reasonably quick. I've never eaten in, so I can only comment on the boba. I am never disappointed with the texture or the taste of the boba. The consistency and yummy taste keep me coming back for more.. Reasoning: The reviewer explicitly states they ""keep coming back for more"" and uses positive descriptors like ""yummy,"" ""delicious,"" and ""reasonably quick."" While they mention the place can be crowded (a potential neutral observation), the overall tone and repeated positive reinforcement strongly indicate a positive experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Service has always been horrible for the past couple years, even when it used to be tea planet. The good boba never makes up for it and their slow staff.. Reasoning: The review explicitly uses negative language (""horrible,"" ""slow"") and expresses dissatisfaction with the service, indicating a consistently poor experience. While the reviewer acknowledges the boba is ""good,"" this is overshadowed by the negative comments about the service.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: service could be better, or maybe i am used to service back in 626?\n\ntea was alright, too much ice.. Reasoning: The review expresses dissatisfaction with the service (""service could be better"") and also notes a negative aspect of the tea (""too much ice""). While ""tea was alright"" is a slightly positive comment, the overall tone leans towards criticism. The reference to better service elsewhere further reinforces this negative impression.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I don't like that you can't just hang out here, you have to actually make a purchase of a minimum of $5 or they kick you out. Overall, cute little tea place that's open until 2am.. Reasoning: The review expresses a clear negative point – the mandatory purchase requirement and potential for being asked to leave. While it acknowledges a positive aspect (""cute little tea place"" and late hours), the frustration regarding the purchase policy overshadows it. The negative aspect is stated directly and holds more weight in the overall impression.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: This is my second time coming here and I dont plan coming back. Although the drinks are delicious, the service is the worst. My friends and I were only allowed 40 minutes to order even though there was still an hour left on the clock. Our waiter spent half of our 40 minutes ignoring us. After finally getting his attention and order we tells us they're out of boba. What?! I work at a boba place in California and we will make boba or any drink even if it is 5 minutes before closing. Our customers are very important to. Reasoning: The review expresses overwhelming negative sentiment despite acknowledging the delicious drinks and convenient hours. The writer details multiple instances of extremely poor service, including time limits, inattentiveness, running out of a key ingredient (boba), and shockingly rude behavior from the waitstaff. The writer explicitly states they will not return and compares the establishment’s practices unfavorably to their own workplace, highlighting a complete lack of customer appreciation. The positive aspects are significantly overshadowed by the negative experiences described.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I really don't like this place. Their service is so terrible. They always give me an attitude, and they're oh so rude. The only reason I come here is my friends like some of their drinks. I don't want to be a picky snob and insist we go somewhere else. I'll never have a day where I'll be like, \""hey, let's go to tea station!\"" Icy juicy will provide a much better service.. Reasoning: The review overwhelmingly expresses negative feelings. Phrases like ""I really don't like this place,"" ""terrible service,"" ""attitude,"" and ""rude"" are strong indicators of dissatisfaction. While the reviewer mentions friends liking some drinks, this is presented as the *only* reason they return, and is overshadowed by the persistent complaints about the staff's behavior. The final sentence explicitly states a preference for a competitor.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: The food is alright along with the drinks. My friends and I like to come here to catch up and hang out and for the boba. I think what bothers me the most is the terrible service. The staff is always hanging out in the counter talking the day away. I've been coming here for years now and as the years go by the service gets worst every time. I've had to get up from my table a few times just to their attention. It just makes not want to come back. Reasoning: While the reviewer expresses enjoyment of the food, drinks, and boba, the dominant and repeatedly emphasized negative aspect is the consistently poor service. They explicitly state the service is ""terrible,"" gets ""worst every time,"" and requires them to actively seek attention. The concluding sentence, ""It just makes not want to come back,"" strongly indicates a negative overall experience outweighing the positives.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Been here a few times during our late night excursions in Chinatown. This has been our go-to spot for last minute get togethers with friends. \n\nPros:\n- fairly cheap\n- open late, (until 2:00am)\n\nThe first time around, I tried the hot Mango Black Tea. I couldn't finish it, as It was a little too sweet for my taste. After trying a few of the other selections on the menu, I settled on the Pineapple coconut yogurt snow ice boba as my new favorite drink here. The sweet butter toast is pretty addicting, and to me, it is a lighter version of toasted. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive. While there are acknowledged drawbacks (parking and crowding), these are presented as minor inconveniences rather than dealbreakers. The reviewer explicitly states it's their ""go-to spot,"" praises the sweet butter toast (""pretty addicting""), and ends with a definitive ""Yes, we'll be back!"" The positive aspects significantly outweigh the negatives, demonstrating a favorable overall experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Tea Station is a good place if you're looking for a quick pick me up when its late at night. I usually go here with my friends before we hit the Vegas nightlife scene or after we have had dinner. It gets busy around 9pm-11pm. The atmosphere is very casual and. Their service has gotten better than when I first came in 2-3 years ago. The staff is more attentive and conversant than before. They have a wide variety of teas to choose from; as well as various food items. I like to order their taro milk tea with boba.. Reasoning: The review uses positive language like ""good place,"" ""better,"" ""attentive,"" ""conversant,"" and explicitly states enjoyment (""I like to order...""). While it mentions it gets busy, that's presented as a neutral observation rather than a complaint. The overall tone expresses satisfaction with the experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: This place is located in China town in a very popular part of town. I love their milk tea boba and mango slush. The workers are kind of weird and don't really have manners. I still go here often despite the service. It's a good place to hang out.. Reasoning: While the reviewer notes a significant negative aspect – the workers' behavior – they explicitly state they ""still go here often"" and describe it as a ""good place to hang out."" The positive mentions of the milk tea boba and mango slush, combined with the repeated indication of continued patronage despite the service issues, outweigh the negative comment. The reviewer is clearly finding value in the establishment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Love this place since it was tea planet.. Reasoning: The reviewer explicitly states ""Love this place,"" which is a strong positive indicator. The reference to a previous name (""tea planet"") suggests a fondness for the establishment even through changes, further reinforcing the positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I visited this location for boba. Compared to other asian boba places, this location is very clean, professional, and organized. I really like the interior of the establishment and the professional business feel. Other boba shops even nearby are very poorly designed and not very professional.. Reasoning: The reviewer uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""very clean,"" ""professional,"" ""organized,"" ""I really like,"" and explicitly contrasting this location favorably against other, ""poorly designed"" and ""not very professional"" shops all indicate a highly positive experience. There are no negative comments or criticisms.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Bull shit customer service. Although I still go 3 times a month. Bull shit. Customer service. \nOh and did u know: you cant bring pastries or any outside food into this place? Even though you order like five things. Lmfao. \nI need to find a new place. -.-. Reasoning: While the reviewer admits to returning to the establishment three times a month, the overwhelming tone is extremely negative. The repeated use of ""Bull shit"" to describe the customer service is a strong indicator of dissatisfaction. The sarcastic ""Lmfao"" and the complaint about the outside food policy further emphasize the negative experience. The concluding statement about needing to find a new place solidifies this negative sentiment. The frequency of visits is almost certainly motivated by convenience or habit rather than genuine satisfaction.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Call me spoiled but I'm used to the land of boba and milk tea, Los Angeles. I guess that makes me a boba snob? Is that even a thing? I guess it can be. \n\nI'm still trying to find a good place for boba, teas and snacks in Vegas and my quest has come up with nothing so far. I tried Tea Station out one afternoon after having lunch with some friends in Chinatown. I've been to the ones in SoCal before and expected it to be pretty much the same thing. \n\nI guess it was okay. I had a. Reasoning: The review is complex and contains both positive and negative aspects. The reviewer explicitly acknowledges being a ""boba snob"" and expresses disappointment with the quality compared to what they's used to in Los Angeles. They find the price a bit high and the grass jelly ""just alright."" However, they also highlight the extensive menu as a positive, and express a desire to return and try the popcorn chicken. The parking situation is presented as a minor inconvenience. Overall, the tone is more leaning towards a mixed or slightly negative experience, but with a flicker of potential for future enjoyment.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: I have certainly had many facials in my life, as not being blessed with great skin. I had a facial last month at Globe, and it was in my top two of all time!\n\nGina was fantastic, addressed all of my concerns and didn't judge me for all my skin sins. From start to finish, the service was not only incredibly helpful (I got the baking soda Microderm), but thorough, relaxing, with all of those touches that are so easily missed in some facials. \n\nI know they are known for great hair, but anyone should run, not walk to have a. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""top two of all time,"" ""fantastic,"" ""wonderful place,"" ""incredibly helpful,"" ""thorough,"" ""relaxing,"" and ""counting down my days"" clearly indicate a highly favorable experience. The reviewer expresses genuine enthusiasm and appreciation for the service and the aesthetician.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Being a boba fanatic, when I saw tea station, I got excited because the tea station in both Fremont and San Diego are both very good. However, when I ordered royal milk tea here, it tasted very fake. On the menu it said earl grey tea but tasted remotely similar. Also they never asked me what level of sweetness I wanted which I recall being a pretty big point to this chain. The boba balls are good though! I didn't like the drink it didn't give me that satisfying boba feeling. My friends got the rose milk tea and regular. Reasoning: The review expresses significant disappointment with the tea itself, which is the core product of a boba shop. The reviewer explicitly states the tea tasted ""very fake,"" wasn't like other Tea Station locations, and didn't provide the expected ""satisfying boba feeling."" While the reviewer acknowledges positive aspects like the seating, being open on Xmas Eve, and the music selection, the overwhelming impression is one of dissatisfaction with the primary offering. The negative comments about the tea outweigh the positives.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Today was my first visit to Globe Salon, and I really enjoyed the experience. Sam provided a great consultation, great cut, and several styling tips! I am so excited to have found my new favorite salon in LV!. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language.

There are no negative comments or criticisms present.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Very bad customer service in this location waited 20 minutes for a worker to come and answer my question on a electrical device only to find out he didn't even know what I was talking about and not only that their products are a bit over priced...I found the same product I needed at the Home Depot for 2.00 less and my question was answered.. Reasoning: The review contains strongly negative language (""Very bad,"" ""didn't even know,"" ""over priced""). The customer explicitly describes a frustrating experience with poor customer service and highlights a significant price disadvantage compared to a competitor. These elements overwhelmingly point to a negative experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: so, im having kinda of a rough start to my 3 day weekend. so I decided to go to blueberry hill, to get some potato pancakes and coffee. first off, I know this place, so I brought my own coke, being that they are a pepsi establishment. I order my potato pancakes as a meal with eggs and a protein. I went with eggs, over hard and bacon. when my food came, I got sausage and runny eggs, the waitress never came back to check on me so I could have it corrected. I ate my potato pancakes and about. Reasoning: The review expresses significant dissatisfaction. While the reviewer initially sought comfort food and seemed to have a specific craving, the order was incorrect, the service was inattentive (waitress never checked on them, late to address the issue), and the resolution was inadequate. The reviewer explicitly states they paid full price and left no tip, highlighting their disappointment and frustration. The concluding remarks about the waitress’s performance further solidify the negative experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: 1 star for the excellent 1960s Wim Wenders film squalor and the hell-no-we're-not-being ironic ambiance.\n\n1 star for the cans of 1970s deodorant powder.\n\n1 star for the old and yellowed photos of old Vegas on the walls, and for the hokey mother's day cards in the card rack (also vintage, also just there because they still happened to be in stock). \n\nAnd don't get me wrong, I luv non-ironic squalor just as much as the next former punk rock performance artist turned librarian, HOWEVER (imagine very prissy-ass voice here): your disregard for hoity-toity culinary standards IS NO EXCUSE FOR EGGS FRIED. Reasoning: This review is incredibly complex and layered, but ultimately leans negative. While the reviewer expresses appreciation for the unique, retro atmosphere and aesthetic (""excellent 1960s Wim Wenders film squalor,"" ""sweet cashier""), this is heavily outweighed by extremely negative commentary on the food and beverage. The language used to describe the breakfast is overwhelmingly harsh (""eeeecccchhhh,"" ""putrid,"" ""toupee, mixed withh the bile of a thousand disappointed stand-up comics""). The sarcastic tone and elaborate, dismissive descriptions of the food clearly indicate a deeply unfavorable experience. The final recommendation to ""Don't stay for the food"" seals the negative classification. The humor attempts to. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Love Dino's and I went when there were only four other people in there. I understand that karaoke is awesome there, but it's also just a great spot to grab a drink since it's got a lot of space, parking and is full of locals so you can avoid all the douchiness of the strip. \n\nI had an arepa at the spot on the corner which was pretty good and got some dessert frozen custard across the street at Luv It - a great one-two before washing it down with some alcohol at Dino's!. Reasoning: The reviewer uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""Love Dino's,"" ""awesome,"" ""great spot,"" and ""great one-two"" clearly indicate a favorable opinion. While they mention avoiding ""douchiness,"" this is framed as a positive aspect of Dino's by contrasting it with a negative elsewhere. The overall tone is enthusiastic and appreciative.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: This bar is now one of my favorite places in Las Vegas. 2 shots & a beer for $9?? Yes please! The crowd was so diverse and the karaoke was fabulous! We went there on a Saturday night and it was crowded, smokey and fun. If you can't handle smoke, then this is not the place for you! The bartenders have a stiff pour and the rest of the staff is very friendly. Please be advised that true to Dive Bar standards, there is only one toilet in the bathroom, so you WILL be waiting to take a pee, so. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive. While the reviewer acknowledges some drawbacks (crowded, smokey, single bathroom), these are presented as characteristic of a ""Dive Bar"" and don't detract from the enthusiastic praise. The phrases ""one of my favorite places,"" ""fabulous karaoke,"" ""friendly staff,"" and ""stiff pour"" (often a positive in a bar context) all contribute to a highly favorable impression. The playful warning about the bathroom is also presented in a humorous, not critical, way.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Dino's is definitely a dive bar but it's amazing because of it! The bar itself is by no means big in fact I think it could comfortably accommodate about 120 people and that is being generous. The bartenders are friendly and service is pretty prompt but when a rush comes in the drink service does slow down a bit and I don't think it's the bartenders fault more the size of the bar itself. The drinks were reasonably priced and the atmosphere is great! Did I mention they have karoake? If I didn't let me tell you, they have a. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. While acknowledging the bar is a ""dive bar"" (which isn't inherently negative), the reviewer frames this as a positive attribute (""amazing because of it!""). They praise the friendly bartenders, reasonable prices, great atmosphere, and the fun karaoke experience. The only minor criticism (service slowing down during rushes) is attributed to the bar's size, not the staff, and is presented in a forgiving manner. The final statement, ""This bar is my new favorite,"" is a strong indicator of positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: If there was ever a cheezy moment in my life, it was here. I was coming back on deployment from the Middle East on RR. and I wanted to renew our wedding vows that we made a couple years earlier. The staff was friendly.... We went through the drive through and did it through the window.... then got out of the car and started taking all these cheesy photos.... I think they knew exactly what we wanted.... It was awesome... Reasoning: While the reviewer initially describes the experience as ""cheesy,"" they clearly embrace this and find it ""awesome."" The acknowledgement of the staff's friendliness and the overall positive tone regarding the unique vow renewal ceremony outweigh the initial descriptor of ""cheesy,"" which is used in a self-aware and appreciative way. The reviewer highlights specific positive actions by the staff.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Not as good as champagne's but it will do. Went for a friend. Not feeling the karaoke. So we left for better entertainment. There was only one bartender, but he was awesome. The dude running the karaoke was funny. But we aren't really karaoke people so we left for greener pastures. If you like dive bats with cheep, good drinks then head over.. Reasoning: This review is a mixed bag, but ultimately leans towards neutral with a slightly negative tilt. While the bartender is praised (""awesome"") and the karaoke host is described as ""funny,"" the reviewer explicitly states it ""won't do"" compared to another establishment, expresses disinterest in the karaoke (""Not feeling the karaoke""), and ultimately left for ""better entertainment."" The comment about ""dive bats"" and ""cheep, good drinks"" is a potentially positive descriptor for some, but carries a slightly dismissive tone in this context. The overall impression is one of disappointment and a lack of enjoyment, despite a couple of positive aspects.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: They called us to come At 2.we waited more than an hour for the assistance .wtf.we made a reservation before.bad service. Reasoning: The review expresses significant frustration and dissatisfaction. Phrases like ""waited more than an hour,"" ""wtf,"" and ""bad service"" are strong indicators of a negative experience. The mention of a reservation being ignored further amplifies the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Mediocre food. Unlimited eating for $30 per day. Go to Belagio buffet for lunch at 3pm instead. $20. Much better. \\. Reasoning: While the reviewer acknowledges the ""unlimited eating"" aspect, the primary focus is on the food being ""mediocre."" The strong recommendation to go elsewhere (Belagio buffet) and a direct comparison highlighting its superiority (""much better"") significantly undermines any potential positive impression. The negative assessment outweighs the single, somewhat lukewarm, positive mention.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: We decided to eat here during our vacation in Vegas. We saw a lot of promotion for a half pound of crab with an 8 oz. crab for $9.99! We couldn't pass up this deal so, we decided to go check it out. We didn't realize the fine print that says we had to be a VIP member to get the exclusive discount. \n\nThe food came out pretty good. The crab legs were served a little weird. Usually, you would have to open the crab legs yourself, but they are served in halves so the dirty work is already done. Reasoning: The review expresses a mixed bag of experiences. The reviewer was initially lured in by a promotion but felt misled by the VIP membership requirement. While the food itself (""pretty good"") and the pre-cracked crab legs were appreciated, there were disappointments regarding the steak's size and the lack of restrooms. The language used is fairly mild, with more focus on pointing out discrepancies and inconveniences rather than expressing strong negativity. The overall tone leans towards a slightly negative experience due to the misleading promotion and lack of amenities, but the positive aspects prevent it from being overtly negative.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: This buffet was way better than than the circus circus no doubt! Thanks server bobby for making it enjoyable and for getting everybody to sing for my ten year old!! The food was ok but...my favorite is the eggs benedict and the crab legs!. Reasoning: While the reviewer mentions the food was ""ok"" (a slightly lukewarm comment), the overwhelming tone is positive. They explicitly state the buffet was ""way better"" than another establishment, praise the server Bobby for creating a fun atmosphere and facilitating a singalong, and highlight specific dishes they enjoyed (eggs benedict and crab legs). The positive experiences clearly outweigh the minor qualification about the food quality.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: This place is conveniently located in the Stratosphere. Cheesy atmosphere and singing waiters and waitresses with decent voices, not the place to go if you're easily cheesed out. \n\nFood was only decent, IHOP quality, which isn't great quality. I got the California omelette, which was mostly good, except the cheese was pathetically thrown on top, barely melted. The hash browns were fairly crunchy, and the toast was the typical crappy bread soggy with cold butter \nthey give you in breakfast joints.\n\nI tasted my friend's french toast which had real blueberries, and it was pretty good.. Reasoning: While the review acknowledges a convenient location and the french toast was ""pretty good,"" the overwhelming tone is critical. The reviewer uses words like ""cheesy,"" ""pathetic,"" ""crappy,"" and compares the food quality to IHOP, which isn't a compliment. While there's a sliver of positivity with the french toast, the negative aspects of the food and atmosphere are emphasized throughout.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Philly Cheese Steak gave me heart burn bad!\n\nRather not go here again!. Reasoning: The review explicitly mentions ""heartburn bad"" and expresses a desire ""Rather not go here again!"". These are strong indicators of a negative experience. The language used conveys dissatisfaction and discomfort.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Recently ate breakfast here on a Saturday morning in mid Oct '13.\n\nWait : 5 mins for 2 patrons at 11:00am. : 4 stars\nDining room : 50's era diner decor. clean and in good repair : 4 stars\nMenu choices: plenty of options, and menu was easy to read : 4 stars\n\nFood : my party ordered :\nveggie omelet - 3 stars, \npancakes - 1 star, (undercooked, raw on the inside)\nscrambled eggs - 3 stars, \nbacon - 3 stars, \nhash brown potatoes - 2 stars (undercooked)\n\nValue : above average prices for quality of food, average prices for quantity of food\n\nSummary :\nMeal was forgetable.. Reasoning: While the review starts with some positive aspects (short wait, clean decor, good menu), the food quality is consistently rated below average. The pancakes are explicitly called ""undercooked,"" and hash browns are also noted as undercooked. The overall summary uses words like ""forgettable"" and ""sub-par,"" and the reviewer states they likely won't return. Despite the neutral tone in places, the negative food experience and ultimate rejection of a return visit strongly indicate a negative overall impression.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Went to this location as it is nearby the Las Vegas Premium Outlet. I like Jack in the Box for their all day breakfast menu, and this place was the closest I could find. I did notice a little bit of an element of drug or prostitution or something was going on. But it did not deter from my experience here; this location was very clean on the outside and inside. My food was good and served at a good temperature; the counter person gave me a refill coffee with a smile. What more can you ask for from a. Reasoning: The review contains both negative and positive elements. The significant negative is the observation of concerning activity (""drug or prostitution""). However, the reviewer explicitly states this ""did not deter from my experience."" They highlight positive aspects like cleanliness, good food temperature, and friendly service (""refill coffee with a smile""). Ultimately, the overall tone leans towards a positive acceptance of the experience, outweighing the initial concern.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: What was I thinking to step foot in this dump? I had family in from out of town that wanted t-shirts to take home to Nebraska. Bonanza has t-shirts, really good ones if you like lame knockoffs and hoochie mama type shirts but nothing you'll want to be seen in outside of Fremont St. much less wearing it in Lincoln, NE.\n\nIf you want 25 different Las Vegas themed shot glasses, CSI knockoffs, used decks of cards from Harrah's, and 6 different colors of dice you'll find it here. You'll also find overly aggressive security who treats everyone as thieves in. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer uses intensely critical language throughout, describing the shop as a ""dump,"" criticizing the merchandise as ""lame knockoffs,"" and detailing negative experiences with security and staff (""overly aggressive,"" ""sourpussed""). They express a desire for the place to be demolished and suggest that photos are sufficient rather than experiencing the actual location. The single redeeming quality mentioned (""the liquor store"") is presented as the *only* positive aspect, further emphasizing the pervasive negativity.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: This is where people in the shows get their supplies- that's what I was told when I was there. This store has been around for years. Huge selection of materials- fabric, sequins, everything for the creative costume ideas. Unique store. \n\nI came over on a saturday afternoon. After a ton of browsing, I ended up buying a couple pieces of fabric (hot pink & purple) that's still in my craft room, but I intend on making something out of it soon- when I borrow a sewing machine. I've been wanting to make some Halloween costumes for a while. \n\nI agree. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""great source,"" ""unique store,"" and the author's excitement about the fabric they purchased all indicate a positive experience. While the reviewer acknowledges higher prices, they frame it as a worthwhile trade-off given the quality and uniqueness of the materials and the cost of pre-made costumes. The concluding statement about wanting to visit another location further reinforces a favorable impression.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Been coming here for 10yrs. Dale and his team are best. They always go the extra mile for me and are very honest about their price. Thank you for the great service. Reasoning: The review expresses consistent positive sentiment. Phrases like ""best,"" ""go the extra mile,"" ""honest,"" and ""great service"" are strong indicators of a positive experience. The longevity of the customer (""Been coming here for 10yrs"") further reinforces the positive assessment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Service at this Denny's was dismal. After waiting for 45 mins for breakfast at 10am, the manager didn't even apologize for the food coming late.\n\nFood was mediocre.\n\nLocation was pretty sketchy.\n\nOnly go to this location if your desperate.. Reasoning: The review uses strongly negative language (""dismal,"" ""sketchy,"" ""desperate""). The explicit mention of a 45-minute wait without apology and the assessment of the food as ""mediocre"" further reinforce the negative experience. The overall tone expresses significant dissatisfaction.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: A great Vegas tradition... it helps that I love frozen custard. Definitely worth a trip for tourists.. Reasoning: The review uses explicitly positive language (""great,"" ""definitely worth a trip""). While it mentions a personal preference (""I love frozen custard""), this reinforces the positive experience rather than detracting from it. The recommendation for tourists further solidifies the positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: GREAT SUCCESS! J and I made it to Luv-It right before they closed. Well, technically they were closed (the closed sign was already in the window) but the girls were nice enough to accommodate my request. They had run out of all the interesting flavors and only had vanilla left, but I wasn't going to complain.\n\nThe texture of the custard was very thick and creamy. More dense than ice cream and not as soft as gelato, it was quite delicious. I wish they had had some of their other flavors available, but I was still happy with what I got.. Reasoning: While the reviewer expresses disappointment about the limited flavor selection (""They had run out of all the interesting flavors and only had vanilla left""), the overall tone is overwhelmingly positive. They acknowledge the staff's willingness to help despite being closed, praise the custard's texture (""very thick and creamy,"" ""quite delicious""), and state they were ""still happy with what I got"" and plan to return. The initial ""GREAT SUCCESS!"" sets a positive context that persists throughout the review.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Good stuff, been coming for years. Glad its getting so much hype they deserve to make some money. Do yourselves a favor and dont expect a religious experience or you will be disappointed. Its simple food made fresh on site and very good.. Reasoning: The review expresses overall positive feelings. Phrases like ""Good stuff,"" ""very good,"" and ""they deserve to make some money"" clearly indicate satisfaction. While the reviewer cautions against expecting something overly elaborate (""not a religious experience""), this is presented as a realistic expectation and doesn't detract from the positive assessment of the food itself. The repeated mention of returning for years further supports a positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I love luv-it. My go to sundae is the western. Lately I have branched out a bit and tried some of their flavors of the day. I might just be used to my sundaes but I prefer them over a flavor of the day in a cone. It is nice they offer different flavors though. I will still give them a try from time to time. There is almost always a line, even in the winter but there is plenty of people watching to do to pass the time. I do wish they were open a little earlier but when. Reasoning: This review expresses overwhelmingly positive feelings towards Luv-It. The reviewer uses phrases like ""I love luv-it,"" ""So good!,"" and declares it their ""fave downtown lunch"" destination. While they mention a preference for their usual sundae over the flavors of the day, and a wish for earlier opening hours, these are minor points and presented in a forgiving and appreciative tone. The acknowledgement of the line and helpful tip about the ATM further indicates a positive overall experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I sooooo wanted this place to be amazing! Everything about it seemed awesome. Its super local in a sort of hidden location. Its been in business for ever and the reviews all rave about it. It may of been a bad night when I went and I am willing to try again to see if my experience was a fluke.\n\nI had the Luv-it special sundae which was good but I felt like it was not really custard and seemed much closer to ice-cream in texture and flavor. It was mostly melted by the time the served it to me and. Reasoning: The review expresses disappointment, which immediately leans towards a negative sentiment. While the reviewer initially had high hopes (""I sooooo wanted this place to be amazing!""), they were let down by the sundae not meeting expectations (texture and temperature issues). The repeated expression of wanting a better experience and the explicit mention of a bad night (""fluke"") suggest a negative experience. However, the willingness to try again and the acknowledgement that things ""tasted good"" prevents it from being purely negative. The cash-only warning is purely informational and doesn't impact the sentiment. Overall, the disappointment outweighs the positives.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Luv-It has an extensive list of flavors but features only a few at a time that change out everyday on top of the regular vanilla and chocolate staples. Frozen custard was a totally new concept for me until my roommate and Luv-It's #1 fan (who is going to flip when he sees the number of stars I gave) took me. It's a richer take on the ice cream I was used to, but gives you the same freedom to choose options that make you thankful to be in America - cone or cup? Toppings or not? \n\nThe downtown location and. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly positive. While the reviewer mentions some drawbacks (no seating, cash-only payment), these are presented with humor and don't detract from their enthusiasm for the custard itself and the unique experience. Phrases like ""Vegas institution,"" ""thankful to be in America,"" and the humorous references to ""Arrested Development"" and the 21st century highlight a very positive overall impression. The reviewer's playful complaints are indicative of someone who genuinely loves the place.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Meh... I thought it was very ok... And the girls working there were rude and seemed very bothered by us. I wouldn't go back. Reasoning: The review uses negative language like ""Meh,"" ""ok"" (in a dismissive way), ""rude,"" and ""bothered."" The concluding statement, ""I wouldn't go back,"" is a clear indicator of dissatisfaction. While ""ok"" could be neutral on its own, the overall tone and explicit negative comments strongly outweigh any potential neutrality.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Luv-it's customer service is the only reason I'm dropping my rating. Y'all were rude, but hot damn if you're not serving up some of the BEST frozen delights in Vegas!\n\nNew ownership means more daily flavors, a slight hike is prices, and rude service. So rude in fact that it makes me not want to return, which makes me sad because the product is phenomenal and a Las Vegas trademark. (Who doesn't like buying custard in a strip club parking lot?)\n\nTo the Asian lady that took over here's some advice.\nSmile.\nThank people.\nDon't scold your employees in front of customers.\nDon't walk away from. Reasoning: While the review expresses significant frustration and criticism regarding the customer service (""rude,"" ""scold employees,"" ""annoyed""), the reviewer repeatedly emphasizes the exceptional quality of the frozen delights (""BEST frozen delights,"" ""phenomenal,"" ""cold sweetness""). The reviewer explicitly states they *want* to return despite the negative experience, highlighting the product's strong appeal. The balance leans towards a positive sentiment because the primary focus is on praising the product, even while acknowledging a major flaw.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Long hailed as one of the best dive bars in Vegas, you'll probably want to know what you're getting into before you head there.\n\nThe regular patrons of Huntridge Liquor have been going there for decades. They're chatty and warm, but the building itself is old, the tile floor dingy. No matters here, the drinks are really cheap and the stories flow as easily as the booze. This is literally old Vegas. If you're looking for somewhere fancy, head on down the road, pardner. But if you love nothing more than sidlin' up to the bar next to an old timer. Reasoning: This review presents a mixed bag of observations. While it acknowledges the bar's age and slightly rundown appearance (""old,"" ""dingy""), the overall tone is affectionate and appreciative of its authenticity and atmosphere. The reviewer emphasizes the charm of the regulars, the cheap drinks, and the feeling of ""old Vegas."" The playful, slightly humorous language (""pardner,"" ""how the west was won"") and the enthusiastic recommendation (""this is the place to do it"") strongly suggest a positive experience despite the acknowledged flaws.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: A guy from a liquor store recommended this place to me a couple of years ago. Since then, I've been to this place every time I'm in Vegas. I've only tried the pizza & wings. Both are GREAT for those late night drunken munchies! Right down the street from the Stratosphere.\n\nYou can easily tell that this is where the locals go for pizza.. Reasoning: The reviewer explicitly uses the word ""GREAT"" to describe the pizza and wings, indicating a very positive experience. They also highlight repeat visits (""every time I'm in Vegas"") and describe it as a place ""where the locals go,"" which implies authenticity and quality. The mention of ""late night drunken munchies"" is casual but doesn't detract from the positive overall tone.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: The worst customer service, and the longest delivery time I've ever experienced! After 2 hours the food showed up cold, the fingers were burnt, and the pizza crust was burnt as well. I posted pic's so please view them. Never again to return!. Reasoning: The review uses highly negative language (""worst,"" ""never again,"" ""burnt""). It details multiple serious issues: terrible customer service, excessively long delivery time, cold food, and burnt food. The reviewer explicitly states they will not return. The inclusion of photos to document the poor quality further reinforces the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: First off, reading these reviews, take them for seriousness with a grain of salt. Comparing Boston with Pizza Hut? Reviews from Coneheads from the planet Kolob, is more like it. And customer service? These people don't try to kiss your ass, they know they have great pizza, you want it or not, and I am fine with that, I don't like ass kissers. The pizza is great, lots a cheese, lotsa toppings, great crust, decent delivery, and an offer you can't refuse on Tuesdays, 2 for 1. Two thumbs up for Boston Pizza. The rest of you can go get. Reasoning: While the review starts with significant negativity regarding the other reviews and customer service approach, the core of the review praises the pizza itself (""great pizza,"" ""lots a cheese,"" ""great crust"") and highlights a positive deal. The strong recommendation (""Two thumbs up"") and dismissal of chain pizza further solidify a positive overall impression despite the initial criticisms. The tone is sarcastic and quirky, but the ultimate message is favorable.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Delivery said 45 minutes came in 1 hr 1/2 . The pizza was disgusting . So much grease , after blotting one slice with a paper towel I went on to use a second , and third ... Soaked completely through . My hands were covered in grease . I can't believe people actually say this is good pizza! Gross! I was starving and couldn't even bring myself to finish a single piece. Will never order from this place again. Reasoning: This review expresses extreme dissatisfaction. The customer explicitly describes the pizza as ""disgusting,"" mentions excessive grease requiring multiple paper towels, describes a negative physical experience (greasy hands), and states they couldn't even finish a slice. The strong negative language and declaration of never returning clearly indicate a very negative experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I have been to Florida Cafe numerous times during the past 8 years because I live with Cubans and I LOVE Cuban food, and this last time will hopefully be my LAST time. It was never better than ok, and now it is ridiculous. The decor is nice, the wait staff is nice. However, the food is terribly expensive and it isn't very good. The rice and beans are mediocre, and the ropa vieja is uninspired. The piss poor service is what sent me over the edge this time. Saturday afternoon, several employees roaming around, but none with the title,. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer acknowledges the nice decor and wait staff, the vast majority of the text focuses on significant problems: the food is expensive and not good, service is ""piss poor,"" specific dishes are criticized (picadillo, papas rellenas), and there's an exploitative photo charge. The comparison to Porto's further emphasizes the low quality. The repeated use of negative language (""ridiculous,"" ""mediocre,"" ""uninspired,"" ""ick"") and the overall tone are clear indicators of dissatisfaction. The final recommendation to go elsewhere seals the negative classification.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I visited the all-you can eat buffet Cuban adjacent to the restaurant. I believe it doubles as a lounge after hour. (The stage, dj booth and large speaker are a dead give away.) \n\nThe location is kind of out of the way. Their sister restaurant (Havana Grill) is much more convenient. The restaurant is located in the Howard Johnson Motel in the sketchy stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard that no one ever talks about (north of the Stratosphere). I only went because I had a Groupon. \n\nThe Good: the arroz con pollo and tres leches cakes (chocolate and traditional) are. Reasoning: This review presents a mixed bag of experiences, but ultimately leans negative. While the reviewer explicitly states some positives (""the arroz con pollo and tres leches cakes are very good,"" ""staff was friendly""), these are overshadowed by numerous criticisms. The location is described as inconvenient and in a ""sketchy"" area. A significant portion of the food is criticized for being poorly managed (too hot, cold, dry). The overall impression is one of disappointment, with the reviewer expressing doubt about returning even with a Groupon, highlighting a lack of enthusiasm.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Well where can I start. Over the past few years I've occasionally dropped in to eat here in hopes that they would improve. Sometimes the foods great and the service sucks or vice versa. I can never seem to get both at the same time. The past couple of times I've eaten here I've found that the food was bland. The maduros tasted like it was fried earlier that day then microwaved when ordered. The beans were lukewarm along with the dish. It seems like they cooked all the food earlier and reheated it when I ordered it. The Sangria. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer mentions occasional glimpses of good food or service, the dominant tone is critical. They describe bland food, reheating issues (“fried earlier that day then microwaved”), lukewarm dishes, a disappointing Yuca con Mojo, and a delayed service experience. The final sentence, ""Not going anymore after this,"" solidifies the negative sentiment. The repeated disappointments outweigh any minor positive mentions.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: The food is AMAZING but the service is absolutely HORRIBLE. The waitress is not very nice and is always in a rush. Do not eat there on your lunch break because you will be late going back to work. My husband went for lunch and ended up walking out because they were taking too long. People who came after him were getting their food 1st. When he was walking out the waitress said his food was on the way out and he said he had been waiting a long time and had to leave she then asked him to pay!!!. Reasoning: While the reviewer uses the strong positive adjective ""AMAZING"" to describe the food, the overwhelming majority of the review details significant and frustrating service issues. The language used to describe the service (""HORRIBLE,"" ""not very nice,"" ""always in a rush,"" ""taking too long,"" ""walking out"") points to a deeply negative experience. The concluding comment questioning the waitress's employment further emphasizes the negativity. Although there’s a suggestion that service might be better when the waitress isn’s present, the overall impression is one of a negative experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: The food was not memorable. The service was lousy. My husband and I were seated and our order was not taken for just over a half hour. We sat there and watched as other groups/individuals were seated and had their orders taken before us. We kept trying to get our waitresses attention and had no success for quite awhile. We should have just walked out. But we stayed, eventually ordered and had an o.k. meal.. Reasoning: The review contains overwhelmingly negative language. Phrases like ""not memorable,"" ""lousy,"" ""not taken for just over a half hour,"" ""kept trying to get our waitress' attention and had no success,"" and ""should have just walked out"" clearly indicate a very poor experience. While the meal itself is described as ""o.k.,"" this is overshadowed by the significant issues with service.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: From the outside, with all the lights I was expecting more. It's fun if you want to kill time and walk around looking at cheap gifts. Lots of security throughout shop, and you cannot carry any large bags in the store. They will take them from you and you can pick up when you exit building.. Reasoning: The review expresses disappointment (""expecting more"") and highlights restrictive policies (bag checks) which detracts from the experience. While it acknowledges a fun aspect (""fun if you want to kill time""), the overall tone is lukewarm and focuses on negatives. The phrase ""cheap gifts"" doesn't necessarily convey a positive assessment either.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: How should I rate and yelp this place without being judge?? Haha I don't care!!! \n\nAway from the kids once again.... Rent a car, drove to Vegas, got there in 3 1/2 hours at 80 mph. arrived at 12:35am. \n\nWe met with 2 other couples, drag them out from the Baccarat tables at Caesars Palace to go grab a drink with us at OG. \n\nThe best way is to call O.G. and make a reservation, they will sent out a limo to pick you up at your hotel. This way you don't pay a cover charge. You buy a greygoose. Reasoning: While the review contains some potentially negative phrasing (""some horrible,"" ""some fake,"" and the slightly awkward description of feeling intimidated), the overall tone is playful, enthusiastic, and focused on a fun experience. The reviewer details a lavish night out with friends, emphasizing the exclusivity (limo service, bottle service) and highlighting the entertainment aspect with a humorous and lighthearted approach. The final recommendation reinforces the positive sentiment – suggesting others will ""have the best time."" The frequent use of playful expressions (""hehehehe,"" ""lol,"" "":))"") further contributes to a positive and amused tone.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Bachelorette party in Vegas = journey to strip club. \nVIP package offers limo service to pick you up from your hotel and drop you back, plus going straight inside and 2 well drinks. \nStarted in the guys room. I felt like the guys all stood behind us just waiting to pounce on an unsuspecting lady and con us out of a lap dance and $20. Nice views though, definitely. Girls room was loud and smoky, don't really remember too much more.\n\nDefinitely recommend getting the VIP package for you and your girls.. Reasoning: The review presents a mixed experience. While the author explicitly recommends the VIP package (a positive indicator), the description of the environment and interactions is concerning and suggests discomfort (""felt like the guys all stood behind us just waiting to pounce""). The mention of smoke and lack of memory also points to a potentially negative or unsettling atmosphere. The positive recommendation of the VIP package is tempered by the overall narrative of a slightly uncomfortable and chaotic experience. Ultimately, the overall tone leans slightly negative due to the described interactions, but the recommendation prevents it from being purely negative.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: I agree 150% with the other reviews I've read about how they \""milk\"" money out of you. I had FIVE different male dancers within a span of 7 minutes whisper in my ear telling me to get my friend (the bride to be) on stage for a dance, and all reminding me that it's $40. They come up to you, start dancing all of up on you, and when they're done, whisper again in your ear...$20. Back home in Hawaii, I got into a male review for free and they do waaaay more for basically nothing. The only time you. Reasoning: The review expresses overwhelmingly negative sentiment. The reviewer explicitly states agreement with other negative reviews regarding being ""milked"" for money. They detail a high-pressure sales tactic by the dancers, describing repeated attempts to extract money for dances. They also criticize the value for money (expensive drinks, small portions), and even make a critical comment about the dancers' appearances. The overall tone is one of frustration and disappointment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: \""Free limo and no cover\"" my ass. Upon arriving at the OG, in the ghetto, by a limo that we were told was \""completely free\"", we were informed that it would be $25 per person. Granted this included 2 drinks, but I want to dictate my boozing, not someone else. So I get my drinks, which are completely watered down by the way, and watch some of the girls. Some were pretty, most were not and all but one were pushy. No, I don't want a dance. If I do, I know where to find you and how to ask. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer uses extremely harsh and aggressive language (""my ass,"" ""fucks,"" ""die in a fire""). They detail a series of negative experiences, including deceptive advertising (the ""free"" limo), watered-down drinks, pushy dancers, rude behavior from performers, and exorbitant pricing for basic drinks (like a ginger ale). The tone is sarcastic, angry, and resentful throughout. While there's a single compliment directed at one waitress, it’s buried within a barrage of complaints and ends with a violent wish for the rest of the establishment..

"Review: Don't waste your money here. The guys are aggressive and talk gibberish to have you pay $20 to rub their sweaty balls on you. It is utter disappointment. Save your money and go see a produced show. They'll come swarming like bees and then run away when you don't take them up on their offer. Never again.. Reasoning: This review uses extremely negative language and describes a deeply unpleasant and exploitative experience. Phrases like ""Don't waste your money,"" ""aggressive,"" ""utter disappointment,"" and the graphic details shared leave absolutely no room for a positive interpretation. The reviewer expresses strong dissatisfaction and a definitive intention to never return.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Just went here let me say it was lots of fun , very pact seating wasn't too great, drinks were good make sure you get JOAN he is beyond dreamy, sexy and just BEAUTIFUL you definitely won't regret it!!!!!. Reasoning: While there's a minor complaint about ""very pact seating,"" the overwhelming tone is enthusiastic and positive. The reviewer explicitly states it was ""lots of fun"" and lavishes praise on a staff member (""beyond dreamy, sexy and just BEAUTIFUL""). The exclamation points further amplify the positive sentiment. The minor seating complaint is overshadowed by the intense positive reaction to the experience and a specific employee.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I found Snick's first on Yelp looking through a list of dives near Theatre 7, and through word of mouth (a friend who had been there before). Snick's, being just two spaces down from Theatre 7 was the ideal candidate for drinks after an event held in the lot this past First Friday/Pollygrind kick-off party event.\n\nThe bartender (the shorter, gray haired fella) was incredibly friendly, and cracked jokes all night with everybody he talked to it seemed. The drinks, even the more quality beers, were relatively cheap. I'm told that on Saturday nights there is an evening happy hour that. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""incredibly friendly,"" ""cracked jokes all night,"" ""relatively cheap,"" ""great jukebox,"" and ""most obscure tunes"" all point to a very favorable experience. The reviewer actively sought out the bar and was pleased with their find. There are no complaints or negative remarks to balance the positive sentiments.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Go see Randy! That's all I have to say. Every time I go in, I talk sports with him and he does a great job. It's worth every penny there. Great atmosphere, up to date sports magazines, flat screen TV's, and great people. Just an all around cool and chill place to be.. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""great job,"" ""worth every penny,"" ""great atmosphere,"" ""cool and chill place,"" and the enthusiastic recommendation to ""Go see Randy!"" clearly indicate a very favorable experience. There are no negative comments or criticisms present.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I'd rate it a ZERO if I could. Sat down & was not even acknowledged. After 15 minutes I decided to leave. Waiters & waitresses saw us but never once came to our table. RUDE. OH! & the place smelled like shit & they couldn't even spell Fried rice correct in their menu. Steeeer Awayyyy.. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The user explicitly states they would give a zero-star rating, uses harsh language (""RUDE,"" ""smelled like shit""), details a significant lack of service (being ignored for 15 minutes), and criticizes the establishment's hygiene and even their menu. The excessive punctuation and capitalization further emphasize the reviewer's strong negative feelings.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I used to shop at this thrift shop a lot in my 20's. I used to love wool v-neck sweaters and vintage button down cardigans (kinda like the ones that Mr. Rogers wore)- and yes, they had that old funky smell someone mentioned on another thrift store review (so cali). I had a vintage clothing addiction that sometimes this place would feed- navy uniforms, dresses, printed collared shirts, wool plaid shirts. I was in college at the time and wanted to express myself through clothing, plus I didn't really want to wear what everyone else was wearing (I still shopped. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly positive. While the reviewer acknowledges a ""funky smell"" and mentions the store being small, these are presented as minor, almost expected characteristics of a thrift store. The reviewer expresses nostalgia and fondness for past experiences, highlights treasured finds, praises the former manager's positive demeanor, and explicitly states an intention to revisit (""I need to check this place out again""). The overall tone is appreciative and conveys a sense of personal connection to the shop.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: We were the only ones in there on a sunday afternoon which I thought was weird after my friend raved about this place. Our food came out so fast that they would not even have had time to microwave it and put it on a plate so I know everything was pre-made. Food tasted alright just tons of bones in the chicken and the fried pork was so hard I almost chipped my tooth. Is this how you cubans prefer it? \n\nParking lot is around back. Absolutely ensure that you lock your car and DO NOT walk alone in this. Reasoning: While the reviewer mentions positive aspects like friendliness, bilingual staff, and avoiding food poisoning (which is a significant positive!), the overwhelming tone is critical. The review explicitly calls out concerns about pre-made food, inedible textures (hard pork, bones in chicken), and a safety warning about the parking area. The ""Is this how you Cubans prefer it?"" comment is particularly negative and sarcastic. The willingness to return with caveats (“hopefully they’ll make it fresh”) indicates a mixed but ultimately leaning towards a negative experience. The three-star rating itself is a sign of a reluctant compromise, not strong endorsement.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Set along the decaying ruins of Las Vegas Boulevard South, Rincon Criollo is a true departure from the glitter and gulch of Vegas. There seems to be something of theme developed along LVBS, with a Salvadorian and another Cuban restaurant in proximity to each other. This one is set in a bland storefront, but once inside the atmosphere feels more Havanian than anything else. The food is simple and spicy and delectable: hot crusty bread and butter, as mentioned in another review, spicy chorizo, steaming rice and beans, chicken that cleaves to the bone, yuca and plantains and pressed cuban. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly positive. While the reviewer acknowledges the unusual and somewhat bleak surroundings (""decaying ruins,"" ""tawdry titty bars,"" ""near shantytowns,"" ""strangely charmless vista""), these observations are presented as part of the restaurant’s unique charm and authenticity. The core of the review focuses on highly positive descriptions of the food (""simple and spicy and delectable,"" ""hot crusty bread,"" ""chicken that cleaves to the bone""), the atmosphere (""Havanian""), and the service (""genuine hospitality,"" ""helpful smile""). The reviewer explicitly states they ""thoroughly enjoyed"" the experience and finds the restaurant's existence, despite its location, ""oddly dislocated"" but fitting. The language used is. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I've been coming here for years and everytime it's just as good as the last and the portions are satisfying especially for the price. The bread in beginning is light and toasty, the before you know it your food is here. Flavorful rice, black beans, salsa chicken and chicken bistec is the best I've tried so far. Who cares about the neighborhood no one bothers you, it's just at the north part of the strip where all of the chapels are.. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""just as good as the last,"" ""satisfying,"" ""best I've tried so far,"" and ""flavorful"" clearly indicate a positive experience. Even the comment about the neighborhood is framed as a positive (""Who cares...no one bothers you""). There are no negative descriptors or complaints.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: As I came into this quaint little place with a loud soap opera tv show being played in the background, the fresh and wonderful smell of a hot cup of Cuban coffee brewing and an old lady that looks alot like my grandma in bedroom slippers sweeping the floor, I knew right then that I came into a gloriously authentic Cuban hole-in-the-wall in the midst of all the noise and hype of the usual Las Vegas. All men and women must try this little piece of HONEST and downright DELICIOUS rustic cuban cuisine.\n\nAs I ordered my food, I realize that. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive. The author uses enthusiastic language throughout, describing the experience as ""gloriously authentic,"" ""honest,"" ""delicious,"" and ""simply good grub."" They repeatedly emphasize the genuineness and quality of the food and atmosphere, contrasting it favorably with other, more commercialized options in Las Vegas. The detailed and appreciative descriptions of each dish, and the personal connection established (""just as I liked it, as my own mother used to make it""), strongly indicate a very positive sentiment. The almost playful demand (""You are now obligated to try..."") further reinforces this positive tone.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Since this place was close by I chose them for a smog check. My check engine light was on, and apparently when that light is on it's an automatic fail. I didn't know this beforehand. Anyhow about 45 minutes later I was called into the shop and told my car looked fine, but I needed a flush and this and that. I said no, my car isn't fine, it overheats. So now the man (manager?) was now trying to sell me something else. So I told him I would think about it. I was walked over to the desk and. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer expresses frustration and distrust throughout the entire experience. They cite multiple issues: being misled about the smog check failure due to the check engine light, feeling pressured into unnecessary services, feeling the business was dishonest about the reason for the failure, having services listed on the receipt that weren't offered, and ultimately, vowing to never return. The language used (""never, ever go back,"" ""dishonest,"" ""automatic fail"") clearly indicates a negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I checked out this dealership on Yelp prior to visiting them as I found them online and was interested in a truck they had listed on Cars.com. I read the Yelp reviews... some great, and some poor and decided I'd make a visit to see the truck even though they had some pretty bad reviews on here.\n\nI don't live in Vegas, but am in town right now for Pubcon (a Search Marketing conference) for the next few days. I contacted them and let them know I wanted to set up an appointment with them on Wed. morning to see the. Reasoning: The review details a frustrating experience with a dealership. While the reviewer acknowledges reading mixed reviews beforehand and proceeding with an appointment, the core of the review focuses on the significant waste of their time. The dealership confirmed the appointment, seemingly knowing the truck was already sold, and then proceeded with a full sales process before revealing the vehicle's unavailability. The reviewer explicitly states they are annoyed and accuses the dealership of manipulative sales tactics. The language used (e.g., ""waste of my time,"" ""manipulative,"" ""total waste"") and the overall tone are highly critical.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: This is where poor lambs go to get slaughtered. I should have brought my gun with me in here 8 yrs ago when they did not want to give me back my keys after I test drove their camry. I was a young pup back then but stupid me for bringing in a blank check. They passed me up their hierarchy of sales lowlifes trying to close the deal. I had to rip the blank check in their faces so they would give me back my keys. If you have a concealed weapons permit and a handgun, proudly wear it. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The language is intensely hostile and uses extremely derogatory terms (""poor lambs to get slaughtered,"" ""sales lowlifes""). The writer describes a past traumatic experience involving a dispute over a car, suggesting a deep-seated anger and distrust. The suggestion to bring a concealed weapon further emphasizes the negative and aggressive sentiment. There is absolutely nothing positive expressed.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: lord have mercy on my bowels...the burritos will cause you pain. eat one if you need a colon cleanse. only eat here during the zombie appocolypse. Reasoning: This review uses extremely negative language. Phrases like ""lord have mercy on my bowels,"" ""cause you pain,"" ""colon cleanse,"" and comparing the experience to a ""zombie apocalypse"" all strongly indicate a highly unpleasant and negative experience. There's absolutely no positivity expressed.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: What a great meal and a great night! We dressed up in vintage and went and had a ball. \n\nWe started with drinks at the full bar. Our bartendress was jovial and knew her craft. \n\nOnce we were seated, the service staff was unfussy, professional yet friendly, and perfect. \n\nWe ordered the Calamari, Artichokes Franchese and Buffalo Mozzerella appetizers. The artichokes were so good I asked to changed my main dish to them over some angel hair pasta, which they graciously obliged. Everyone of us loved their meal (I have to admit, I was so into my meal that I. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses enthusiastic language like ""great,"" ""had a ball,"" ""jovial,"" ""perfect,"" ""lovely,"" and ""fantastic."" They explicitly state everyone loved their meal and that the experience was so good they intend to return frequently (""must-see every single frickin' time""). The detailed praise of the staff, food, and entertainment all contribute to an exceptionally positive impression.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: If I could give this place NO stars, I would! The polishes are super cheap (I ended up repainting when I got home), waited and stood in the entrance while a rude worker directed where clients went and offered no open seating to the others standing in the front of the shop, nor cared. ICE COLD water for manicure bowl, no base coat, high upsells on basic polish designs and asked for an additional $1 for using my debit card AFTER it was swiped and signed for (which mean lady in front of shop SHOUTED from her CHAIR to my. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer uses extremely strong language (""NO stars,"" ""rude,"" ""shouted,"" ""unhappy,"" ""drones"") and describes a series of highly unpleasant experiences, including poor quality products, bad service, and an overall disorganized and unpleasant atmosphere. The final statement – ""I'll NEVER BE BACK"" – is a definitive expression of dissatisfaction.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: NEVER GO HERE!! \nI started going here the first time I went it was very pleasant, this second and last time i went was a total disappointment, the so called \""owner\"" is very rude, inappropriate and very unprofessional!! The person who did my nails was hrs worst ever!! She would push my hands very aggressively and made me bleed!! They're unappreciative and say very bad things about the costumers!! I find it extremely unprofessional to act this way even your an owner, I feel like she needs to learn what the meaning of costumer service is! Don't waste your time. Reasoning: The review uses extremely negative language and expresses a highly dissatisfied experience. Phrases like ""NEVER GO HERE!!"", ""total disappointment,"" ""rude,"" ""inappropriate,"" ""unprofessional,"" ""worst ever,"" ""aggressively,"" ""bleed,"" ""unappreciative,"" ""very bad things,"" and ""don't waste your time"" overwhelmingly indicate a strongly negative sentiment. The repeated discouragement and harsh criticism leave no room for a positive interpretation.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: added the lengua taco to the tried list today -- wow -- so delicious...\n\ndon't know what Gabriel is talking about fried fish -- their fish is only served as cocktails or on the half shell (oysters) -- no fish tacos -- nothing fried. And the cashier always speaks english -- she has to since she runs the drive thru, too -- \n\nYes, there aren't that many white folk -- but that's fine with me -- Took my 72 year old white mother for tongue and pastor tacos -- and to share a shrimp cocktail, with watermelon juice -- tears, people,. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses strong, enthusiastic language like ""wow,"" ""so delicious,"" and ""tears, people, tears"" to describe the food. They explicitly state they are looking for flaws but can't find any. While they address some inaccuracies in other reviews (regarding the fish offerings and cashier’s language), their tone is constructive and ultimately very favorable. The overall impression is one of extreme satisfaction.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: walking in to this place you smell all the carne asada cooking on the grill nothing like fresh cooked meat not like other places where they reheat it\nI was worried i wasnt going to find a burrito/taco place coming from san francisco i had 100's to chose from and i got nervous when everyone said robertos was the place to go. Anyways LOS TACOS ROCKS \nthe tacos are loaded meat beans cheese and avocado and the burritos are awesome always hit the spot place is packed during lunch i usually hit up the drive though feel like its a little. Reasoning: The review overwhelmingly expresses positive sentiment. While the reviewer initially voiced a worry about finding a good burrito/taco place, they explicitly state ""LOS TACOS ROCKS"" and praise the generous portions (""loaded meat beans cheese and avocado""), the quality (""fresh cooked meat""), and the satisfying nature of the food (""always hit the spot""). The mention of the place being packed and a preference for the drive-through further suggests popularity and a positive experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: the tacos are off the hook yummmmmmmmy. Reasoning: The review uses highly positive and enthusiastic language (""off the hook,"" ""yummmmmmmmy""). The repetition of ""y"" in ""yummmmmmmmy"" further emphasizes the positive sentiment. There are no negative words or phrases present.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I don't know what happened to this place. I used to eat here at least once a week and LOVED their food. They recently raised their prices and seemingly lowered the food quality. The junior carne asada burrito was always my go to....a good sized burrito for $3. I'd order it without beans and it cost me an extra .60. Since when do places charge to take things OFF?! Oh wait....okay, .60, I'll deal with it. NOW they are charging $4.25 for the same burrito and a DOLLAR to NOT have beans in it. What the fuck? My junior carne. Reasoning: While the reviewer acknowledges a past fondness (""LOVED their food""), the overwhelming tone is one of disappointment and frustration. They express shock and anger at the price increases and the practice of charging extra for omitting ingredients. Phrases like ""So disappointing,"" ""What the fuck?"", and the use of strong language clearly indicate a negative experience. The review details a significant decline in perceived value and quality.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: This was one of my favorite Savers locations. Cute clothes at reasonable prices. However, as of late, talk about price gauging. Used donated jeans for $50. Give me a break! Expressed to manager that their pricing has become unreasonable for used donated clothing. Would not hear any of my comments. I was told that jeans were \""NEW\"" even though it did not have any tags and if I looked up the item online I would find the jeans at the same price. \n\n I thought that Savers was categorized as a \""Thrift Store\"". Since when do you compete with online. Reasoning: While the review starts positively (""one of my favorite locations,"" ""cute clothes at reasonable prices""), the overwhelming tone shifts dramatically to negative. The reviewer expresses strong disappointment and frustration regarding the recent price increases (""price gauging,"" ""unreasonable""), the manager's dismissive response, and the perceived betrayal of Savers' mission as a thrift store. The use of phrases like ""give me a break,"" ""taking advantage,"" and the questioning of the store’s purpose clearly indicate a negative experience. The initial positive aspects are overshadowed by the extensive negative commentary.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Our experience with the office staff has been unpleasant every time, both on the phone and in person for visits. The wait is always long (atleast an hour, even first thing in the morning) and it takes forever to get your questions answered. \nThey are incompetent when it comes to billing/insurance issues and have completely overlooked our past records from other pediatricians (which would have given our child 4 immunizations that he'd already been given.) In order to get an immunization record, we needed to make an appointment for an office visit. \nThe pediatrician was short with us, seemed annoyed. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer details multiple significant problems including unpleasant staff interactions, excessively long wait times, incompetence in billing and record management, a dismissive pediatrician, and a general feeling of being disregarded as a concerned parent. The concluding statement ""We are never coming back here"" is a definitive indicator of a negative experience. The language used is critical and expresses significant dissatisfaction.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I took my newborn at cascade location for her very first visit and the front staff are horrible. They dont make u feel welcome in any way.no hi, no good morning like they hate their job(they suck and miserable). Dont bother calling their medical assistance phone line because no one will reply. We called a couple of times and after 48hrs still had no reply, seems like they dont care about our concerns with the babys health but I bet theyre on point on billing matters. I recommend united healthcare at sw location with dr Dani my other child used. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer ultimately suggests an alternative provider, the primary focus is on a highly critical description of the Cascade location. Phrases like ""horrible,"" ""hate their job (they suck and miserable),"" ""no one will reply,"" ""dont care about our concerns,"" and a general tone of frustration and dissatisfaction clearly indicate a negative experience. The comparison to a better alternative further emphasizes the shortcomings of the Cascade location.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative

Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""serious hair cut and beard trim"" (implying a need fulfilled), ""everything came out clean!"", ""great service,"" ""great vibe,"" ""definitely will be coming back,"" and ""would really recommend"" all strongly indicate a positive experience. The reviewer explicitly praises the barber (Freddie) and the shop's overall quality.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: We purchased our home and it has the warranty paid for through August so of course we used it when having problems with our dishwasher. After having their repair people over here 5 times *(6 weeks of service calls and parts being ordered and then having GE come out and give it a try) GE said it would cost $426 to repair including the part and Home Warranty decided to \""cash out\"" which means they paid us $175 for the part since they weren't willing to pay for the labor. REALLY? To replace it with the exact same unit would. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer details a prolonged, frustrating experience with a home warranty company, highlighting multiple failed repair attempts, a refusal to cover labor costs, a low payout for the part, and a feeling of being misled by the company's customer service. The phrases ""complete waste of time and money,"" ""feel like they are in business to collect…service call fees,"" and the overall tone of exasperation clearly indicate a highly negative experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: No stars for this company. I've had a contract with these people for 8 YEARS since I purchased my home and they came with the sale. In the past 8 years their service was good, never any problems. I had service at my house at the end of November. I had my monthly payment scheduled for the 26th of each month. When I didn't see it deducted for 26 December I called the office. In the past when my contact was to be renewed I would receive a new contact and promptly would renew the contract. When I called on. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer acknowledges past good service (""In the past 8 years their service was good""), the core of the review focuses on a highly unpleasant and frustrating experience with the company's office staff. The language used is strongly critical: ""rudest individual,"" ""idiot,"" ""what kind of business,"" and the explicit recommendation to ""put out of business."" The reviewer’s ultimate decision to switch companies, finding better service at a lower price, solidifies the negative sentiment. The fact that they previously disregarded bad reviews due to positive personal experience only to now contribute one themselves further emphasizes. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Wish I had seen these reviews before going. I will keep it simple. In my opinion this place is a total rip-of as far as the prices charged and the quality/authenticity of the food served. I must say the portions were large, but i guess they have to get rid of the stuff somehow.. Reasoning: The review contains overwhelmingly negative language. Phrases like ""Wish I had seen these reviews,"" ""total rip-off,"" and criticisms of both price and food quality clearly indicate a very dissatisfied customer. While the reviewer acknowledges the large portions, they frame it as a negative – an attempt to dispose of excess food – further reinforcing the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Let me start by saying I'm no authentic German food expert at all. So I don't know how authentic the dishes are. I like the food pretty well. Have gone there multiple times. Love their German potato salad and red cabbage. \n\nThat being said, they get only 3 stars because they are way over priced (go during 2 for 1) for \""doctored\"" dishes. I asked if they make the potato salad and cabbage from scratch and was told no, that it would take too much preptime and that the cook \""doctors\"" them from premade. Also our desert was frozen and. Reasoning: This review presents a mixed bag of opinions, making a straightforward classification challenging. While the reviewer expresses liking the food (""I like the food pretty well,"" ""Love their German potato salad and red cabbage,"" ""they doctor well to me""), the negative aspects significantly temper that positivity. The core complaints revolve around the high prices, the use of pre-made ingredients (""doctored"" dishes), the frozen dessert, dirty tablecloths, and rude service. The 3-star rating itself indicates a less-than-positive experience. While enjoyment of the taste is acknowledged, it's overshadowed by the issues. Given the prominence of the criticisms regarding quality and service, the. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Love this place! First came here in 1996. It's vegan friendly and oh so good. Last night I had the amazing papaya salad and fresh spring rolls. The rolls were mintier than I've had before, but still delicious. I had dinner #3 which came with a tasty fried roll, coconut soup with mushrooms and a garlicky oil on top (forgot the Thai name) and pad thai. Delicious except that the pad thai was too spicy even though I requested mild. It's the first time I've ever had spicy pad thai. The service was fast and friendly. I will go back. Reasoning: The review overwhelmingly expresses positive feelings. Phrases like ""Love this place!"", ""oh so good,"" ""amazing,"" ""delicious,"" and ""awesome"" clearly indicate a positive experience. While the reviewer mentions the pad thai being too spicy (a minor negative), they quickly downplay it and express a strong intention to return. The positive aspects significantly outweigh the single complaint.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: We usually go to Lotus of Siam - in the same seedy center. Don't let the outside fool you. Both places offer great Thai food. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food at Komol. Everything was great - we started with the coconut soup. We also had the spring rolls. Great appetizers. Main courses we selected was a seafood curry dish and the basil, chicken fried rice. Both dishes were really good. When in Vegas - a place to go.. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""great Thai food,"" ""pleasantly surprised by the quality,"" ""everything was great,"" ""great appetizers,"" ""really good,"" and the concluding recommendation ""a place to go"" all indicate a positive experience. While the mention of a ""seedy center"" is a slightly negative observation, it's immediately downplayed with ""Don't let the outside fool you,"" and doesn't detract from the overall positive sentiment about the restaurant itself.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: We ended up at Komol when we couldn't get into Lotus of Siam and it turned out to be a satisfactory alternative. Komol is a Thai restaurant in the same shopping center as lotus of Siam. It's highly regarded as one of the better vegetarian and vegan restaurants in Las Vegas, but we got meat dishes and generally they were quite good.\nWe started with an egg roll or whatever they called it. It was deep fried but may not have contained egg. Nice and crispy on the outside and good flavor on the inside. Next up was the chicken coconut. Reasoning: The review presents a mixed bag of experiences. While the reviewer acknowledges it as a ""satisfactory alternative"" and highlights several positive aspects – the crispy egg roll, excellent entrees (seafood curry and beef basil), fresh seafood, and good flavors – there's also a significant criticism of the beef salad (tough beef, subpar tomatoes). The language used is generally appreciative, but the explicit mention of a disappointment prevents it from being purely positive. The concluding details regarding corkage are simply factual and don't significantly impact the overall sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: It's been a while since I've updated my review for Komol, so here we go. \n\nThe food is still delicious! I finally got to try the herbal salad, since I'm attempting to eat healthier lately. It was refreshing and absolutely delicious. It had just the right amount of spice and the texture was delicious. My dining companions got the mee krob to start and the spicy mint chicken, pork pad thai and some chicken dish that escapes me at the moment. All were incredibly happy with their meals. I took some garlic fried rice with beef home to my fella. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""delicious,"" ""absolutely delicious,"" ""refreshing,"" ""incredibly happy,"" and ""one of my favorites"" clearly indicate a positive experience. While there's a minor mention of service being ""hit or miss,"" the reviewer specifically notes the service was attentive *on this visit*, mitigating the negative aspect. The overall tone is enthusiastic and appreciative of the food and experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I love Thai food and when I read about this, I was so excited to try it! The price is great and the staff is great! The only thing I did not like was when my main dish came out, it was cold. The food itself was just OKAY. The texture of the chicken was a bit rubbery, definitely not all breast meat. I am the biggest panang consumer in all of Las Vegas, and I immediately noticed the panang recipe here is much different than most other Thai restaurants. Not my favorite here. Yet, our Phad See Ew noodles. Reasoning: This review is complex and contains both positive and negative elements. The reviewer expresses initial excitement and praises the price, staff, and menu covers. However, they have significant criticisms of the food itself – the cold temperature, rubbery chicken texture, and a noticeably different Panang recipe. While they enjoyed the Phad See Ew, the overall impression of the food is lukewarm (""just OKAY"") and the Panang disappointment is a significant negative. The mix of praise and disappointment pushes the overall sentiment towards neutral, though leaning slightly negative due to the core food experience being subpar.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: Uh oh, what do we have here? Another contender in the commercial center district looking to claim the prize of best Thai food in Vegas. Everyone knows about the other contender. What I was not aware of, prior to this visit for a mid day impromptu lunch redemption, was that Komol lays out some seriously good Thai food. \n\nSo here I was, far from my comfort zone again trying new and exciting entrees that I would have never even thought of trying before. My arm was twisted twice this day...once to go here in the first place (glad I did). Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive. While the author initially expresses some hesitation (""Uh oh,"" ""far from my comfort zone,"" and a reluctance toward tofu), these are framed as part of a journey of discovery and ultimately overcome. Numerous positive descriptors are used (""seriously good,"" ""delicious,"" ""quite tasty""). The reviewer explicitly states thanks for a ""great meal"" and promises to update the review to a 5-star rating, signaling a very favorable impression. The self-deprecating humor regarding spice tolerance further enhances the positive tone.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Disappointing overall. Spring rolls were unpleasant. Poor flavor and texture. Vegetarian massaman curry was okay. Good spice, overly sweet.. Reasoning: The review uses overtly negative language (""disappointing,"" ""unpleasant,"" ""poor""). While the vegetarian massaman curry is described with a mixed assessment (""okay,"" ""good spice, overly sweet""), the initial and strongest descriptors are negative regarding the spring rolls. The overall impression conveyed is one of dissatisfaction.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: 5 stars for the food! 3 stars for everything else.. This will be the spot I take all my out-of-towners if they are craving some Thai food!\n\nI had some family that were visiting and they were in the mood for some quality grubbing. After doing a quick search on the yelp, I was intrigued by this spot. Following the recommendations of the yelp squad, we quickly made our way over here from the hotel where they were staying.\n\nWhen we arrived here, there was a short 10 minute wait. The atmosphere is very quaint. The first thing I noticed as we. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive regarding the food, with enthusiastic praise for multiple dishes and a clear declaration that it's ""that good."" While the reviewer expresses significant disappointment with the service and the state of the seating (""desperate state of disrepair""), these negative points are framed as detracting from an otherwise exceptional culinary experience.

"Review: Hey I went into this place after reading all the raving reviews.... gotta say was disappointed with the people in it. I walked in and their doors have a chime to let them know ... someone came up to see and did not even say hello nothing. Then 3 to 4 minutes later another patron walks in young blond etc and I suddenly hear him greet her and ask if she would like any help. He also asked another lady who was in the same room if she needed help..\nThese 2 men walked around and not once was i asked. Reasoning: The review expresses significant disappointment and frustration. The reviewer highlights negative experiences with the staff's lack of greeting and assistance, contrasting it with preferential treatment given to other customers. They also state the store wasn’t as impressive as expected. The overall tone is critical and conveys a negative customer experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Absolutely awesome! My husband and I have been talking about getting tattoo's (matching) for some time and while we were in Vegas decided to do it - OMG, some of the people on the strip are on crack with the prices - absolutely nuts! Pay the $10 and grab a cab (they are down by the Stratosphere) so worth it! We had Derrick - what a great job he did!! This was my first tattoo and my husbands I don't know but he agreed best place. I forget the guy's name from the smoke shop next door but he was. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive. While the reviewer mentions inflated prices elsewhere (""some of the people on the strip are on crack with the prices""), they explicitly state the value received was excellent (""so worth it!""), praise the artist (""what a great job he did!!""), and strongly recommend the establishment (""HIGHLY Recommend"").

"Review: The Center recently moved from a tiny, sort of run-down location to a brand-new, absolutely beautiful building. With the move, The Center is still providing their appreciated services to the community, and can now expand to offer even more.\n\nAt The Center, anyone can get STD testing for free, no matter your sexuality. The process is fast with short wait times, and everyone is incredibly professional and nice. They can even draw blood without hurting you or making you cry, as I'm afraid of needles - mega perk. It's hard to beat staying safe for zero cost out of pocket.\n\nOn the. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer highlights numerous improvements (new building, expanded services), praises the professionalism and kindness of the staff, specifically addresses a personal fear (needles) with a positive outcome, and emphasizes the accessibility and generosity of the services offered. The enthusiastic language (""absolutely beautiful,"" ""mega perk,"" ""bomb cafe"") further reinforces the positive sentiment. The concluding call to action (""Get tested!"") is a strong endorsement..

"Review: I was a great fan of this location since it's right next to my place until the unthinkable happened. They delivered bad service. The table was full of crumbs when we were seated. We ordered tea and not only was the spoon still in the tea but it has cheese on it. When we told the manager all we got was, \""i'm sorry.\"" No kind of gasp of OMG, how did this happen. Not even a real sincere apology. This really sucks for me because I love PIE.. Reasoning: The review expresses significant disappointment and frustration. While the reviewer initially states they were a ""great fan"" of the location, the overwhelming tone focuses on negative experiences: bad service, a dirty table, a spoon with cheese in the tea, and a dismissive response from the manager. The phrase ""This really sucks for me"" further emphasizes their negative feelings. The mention of loving pie is a contrasting detail, but doesn't negate the deeply negative overall impression.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: So I went back to Las Vegas Uniforms to return my purchases because I decided to be a sexy cheetah for Halloween instead of a sophisticated doctor (lol). When I initially made my purchases I specifically asked the clerk about their return policy just in case, and she said that I could return everything for a refund as long as the items were clean, unused/unworn with the tags still attached and the original receipt within 60 days... check! I went up to the counter and presented the items to the clerk for a refund (it was a different lady this. Reasoning: The review overwhelmingly expresses negative sentiment. While the reviewer acknowledges the good selection of costumes (""their selection is great""), this is overshadowed by a highly critical account of a rude and unhelpful employee. Phrases like ""snotty attitude,"" ""rude,"" ""customer service is trash,"" and “one of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had” clearly indicate a negative experience. The reviewer also highlights the employee contradicting the store’s stated return policy. Even the attempt at a pleasant ending is dismissed with sarcasm (""Please!!!"").. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: The staff here have been pleasant and the selection isn't bad, limited mainly to Korean goods with a few Japanese products as well [natto, umeboshi & miso]. After a couple of minor problems during check out one day they gave me a free package of a brown rice tea, which I thought was a sweet touch. Since I'm not familiar with a lot of Korean foods, there are a lot of things that I haven't tried or don't know what to do with yet, but they have a lot of Japanese foods that I use often and with a decent. Reasoning: This review contains a mix of positive and negative elements, but the overall tone leans positive. While the reviewer mentions minor checkout problems and the produce not always being fresh, these are presented as minor issues. The reviewer highlights the pleasant staff, a decent selection of goods (especially Japanese), and the thoughtful gesture of the free tea. The observation about the owners' children playing in the store is framed as potentially annoying but not a significant detractor. The reviewer also expresses interest in the eat-in/take-out kitchen. The numerous specific examples of products they appreciate demonstrate a generally positive experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: For a neighborhood market, I think this place is decent. Somewhere to go on your way home from work on school, that isn't a major detour or large shopping trip.\n\nThis place has your essential Korean (and other Asian) goodies. They have household items, nonperishables, frozen, and fresh. They do not have a fresh butchery, but do sell frozen meat at affordable prices. They also have a small fridge of banchan, though the last time I went I thought the selection of banchan was not as good as before.. Reasoning: The review uses relatively neutral language. Phrases like ""decent,"" ""somewhere to go,"" and ""affordable prices"" suggest a positive aspect, but are tempered by the acknowledgement that the banchan selection ""was not as good as before."" Overall, the tone is not overwhelmingly positive or negative; it's a pragmatic assessment of the market's utility. The reviewer isn't expressing strong dissatisfaction, but also isn't particularly enthusiastic.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: Kicked it here for a couple hours last Saturday. It was $10/hr for a regular table and $1/hr for the quarter operated smaller tables. We played by the hour. The two types of tables are mixed together throughout the place and are pretty beat up. The aren't enough cues or triangles for every table. The two cues that we were able to find were hella crooked. \n\nThe bar had $8/domestic and $10/import pitchers. The waitress was nice and comes by to check on if you need more drinks quite often.. Reasoning: The review presents a mixed bag of experiences. While the reviewer mentions the waitress being nice and frequent drink checks as positive aspects, the dominant impression comes from criticisms of the tables – they're ""beat up,"" lacking cues/triangles, and the cues are crooked. The pricing is mentioned but doesn't heavily influence the overall feeling. The criticisms outweigh the positives.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Having been a customer of Tower of Jewels for about 35 years or more I was Yelping and decided to take a look at what people say about the business. I was shocked at the love/hate Yelps. This business is probably the most reputable business of ANY kind in this city and owned and operated by its owner, Jack Weinstein....who takes the utmost pride in his and his employees work and customer service. He and his business are part of the history of our city. Who's Who of past and present are his clientele but treats even small potatoes like. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer explicitly praises the business's reputation, the owner's dedication and pride, the quality of service, and the employees' attitudes. They dismiss negative reviews as reflections of the customer's own behavior and strongly recommend the business, sharing a personal anecdote about exceptional service.

I would be happier getting married at a courthouse then here. Reasoning: This review expresses extreme dissatisfaction and frustration. The reviewer explicitly states they ""wouldn't recommend"" the service, describes a cancelled wedding due to issues with the venue, complains about a non-refunded deposit, and expresses a preference for a courthouse wedding. The language used is negative (""unfortunately,"" ""can't,"" ""would be happier"") and conveys a strong feeling of disappointment and grievance.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: For those of you who don't live in Vegas, this is the company that picks up your trash and recycled items. In the 17+ years I've lived here, they only get 3 Stars from me. Here's why:\n\nPROS\n- They pick up trash on holidays.\n\n- They never miss a scheduled pickup day.\n\n- They will pickup trash up to 6 feet long.\n\nCONS\n- They pick up the recycled items later in the day, which can make the neighborhood messy if it's a windy day.\n\n- They always leave the trash can in the street instead of near the sidewalk. Sometimes, they leave the trashcan at. Reasoning: The review presents a mixed bag of pros and cons. While the reviewer acknowledges positive aspects like consistent pickup, holiday service, and handling large items, the cons regarding messy recycling, improper can placement, and incomplete pickups are significant drawbacks. The concluding statement ""Overall, it's not bad...there's no other option, so I'll have to live with it!"" strongly suggests a grudging acceptance rather than genuine satisfaction. The 3-star rating further reinforces a moderately negative overall impression.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: Amazing company! The best one in Vegas!. Reasoning: The review uses highly positive language (""Amazing,"" ""best"") and an enthusiastic tone, directly praising the company as the ""best in Vegas."" This indicates a strongly favorable opinion.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: At least twice per month Republic Services skips picking up my trash. I've complained five or six times now and they always send out a truck to pick it up, but I shouldn't have to call. I think it may be due to people parking in front of my trash can, but I can't help that. I live across from an elementary school and it is a public street. I've seen better service in a park. \nFurthermore, when my trash is emptied, I find the can in the middle of the street, which is kind of stupid considering I rent. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer details recurring issues with missed trash pickups, a frustrating complaint process, and a lack of professionalism regarding trash can placement. The language is highly critical (""kind of stupid,"" ""I've seen better service in a park""), and the reviewer expresses significant frustration and a feeling of being unfairly treated. The comparison to how the company handles billing versus service further emphasizes the negative sentiment. The final sentence hinting at filing a lien against the company's building solidifies the negative tone.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Horrible customer service!!! I missed one 1 in my account number to pay my bill and I was charged 25.00 for entering the wrong account number!!! I called thinking I have been here paying for over 5 years now and have never done that. Surely they will credit the 25.00 for the typo. Oooo no!!! Bend over and have to take it! Along with all the trash left on the street when they dump the trash!! PLEASE SOMEONE OFFER US ANOTHER OPTION!!!!. Reasoning: The review uses highly negative language (""Horrible,"" ""Bend over,"" ""trash""). The customer expresses extreme frustration and disappointment with the customer service and a feeling of being unfairly charged. The repeated exclamation points further amplify the negative sentiment. The plea for an alternative option reinforces the dissatisfaction.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: The food is very fresh. The service is great. The resturant is one of our favorites. We have been there about once a month. It's not so easy to find. Behind some buildings that are on Sahara. But worth it. Everyone I take there sayes it could be the best Shushi in America! I went there because of the good reviews on Yelp and am glad I did. Had Tuna, Salmon, Eel, California rolls, Halibit, Shrimp, Mushrooms, Soup, Salad and Beet sherbert. Sake was great has Lots of Beers and so full I had to waddel out....Had seconds on Tuna. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses highly complimentary language (""very fresh,"" ""great service,"" ""one of our favorites,"" ""best sushi in America""). They highlight repeated visits (""once a month""), express satisfaction with the food variety, and describe a feeling of fullness and enjoyment (""had to waddle out,"" ""had seconds""). Even the minor inconvenience of the location is dismissed as ""worth it."" The overall tone is enthusiastic and appreciative.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Insanely good find!\n\nWe were visiting from out-of-town and staying on the strip, but decided to check out something a bit outside the \""normal\"" zone. This place was rated highly on Yelp, and so a taxi-ride later ($20), we were there. Where \""there\"" is exactly is hard to say for us, and we had to look around to find the exact location of the place (it's in the middle \""island\"" building on the right). It's located right in the middle of some Korean restaurants, and is definitely not your standard \""strip\"" business - it's not at all notable from the outside.\n\nThe. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses enthusiastic language like ""insanely good find,"" ""fantastic,"" ""extraordinary,"" and ""excellent"" repeatedly throughout the text. They praise the food, the owner's generosity, and the unique experience. While there's a minor complaint about the TVs, it's presented as very minor and doesn't detract from the overall positive impression. The reviewer explicitly states they'll return, which is a strong indicator of satisfaction. They even highlight being willing to spend a significant amount of money due to the food's quality.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Went here with my visiting family for the first time about a month ago...\n\nThe food is pretty good and I must admit, I ordered something a little obnoxious. I had the Tokyo Deluxe which is a little of everything (seriously...just about EVERYTHING) and a cup of tea. \n\nWhile the food I ordered was good, some of the items my family ordered weren't quite up to par. The size of the portions were good but the flavor just seemed a little off on a few of the items.\n\nI'm sure there are other things that taste really good on the menu and. Reasoning: The review expresses a mixed experience. The reviewer explicitly states the food was ""pretty good"" and enjoyed their own order (""Tokyo Deluxe""). However, they also mention that some of their family's dishes were not as good, citing issues with the flavor. The concluding statement about potentially updating the review after returning indicates a degree of uncertainty and hope for a better experience, preventing a definitively positive assessment. This blend of positive and negative aspects pushes the review toward a neutral classification.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: A nice old school Sushi restaurant. Very relaxed feeling, not the uppity type place where you feel not worthy of their time. Very good sushi and very good prices. The chefs were very entertaining and fast. Saki bombs are always best when shared w/the chefs! Soju shots can really sneak up on you!. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""nice,"" ""relaxed feeling,"" ""very good sushi,"" ""very good prices,"" and ""entertaining"" clearly indicate a positive experience. The reviewer explicitly contrasts the restaurant favorably against a negative experience (""not the uppity type place""). While the mention of ""soju shots can really sneak up on you"" is slightly cautionary, it's presented in a lighthearted and playful manner, not a complaint.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: We have been eating here for the last 7 years during CES. It was always amazing. We always looked forward to it. However, the latest reviews I read prior to dining here the first week of 2013 indicated a decline in standards. Unfortunately, I have to agree with those reviews. The sushi was still very tasty. Seafood still nice and fresh. The presentation was still gorgeous. The art of sushi as it affects quality is on the downhill slide. The rolls were somewhat sloppy. About 50% of the pieces fell apart when we tried to pick them up. If they. Reasoning: This review presents a complex mix of positive and negative sentiments, but the overall tone leans negative. While the reviewer acknowledges past positive experiences (""always amazing,"" ""service was great,"" fresh seafood, gorgeous presentation), the core of the review focuses on a significant decline in quality (""decline in standards,"" ""downhill slide,"" ""sloppy,"" ""fell apart""). The disappointment is explicitly stated multiple times, and the possibility of needing to find a new restaurant is expressed, highlighting a loss of a valued tradition. The positive aspects are overshadowed by the criticisms of the food's quality and temperature.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Senator Harry Reid is a moron!!! \n\nThat's it. \n\n-10 stars\n\n\n\nUpdate: I guess only one person here is aloud to have an opinion. Actually I was born and raised here in Las Vegas. So the fact that you are a die hard democrat makes my opinion uneducated. No the fact that Harry Reid puts so much time and effort into trying to get Yucca Mtn. stopped instead of embracing it is where I am coming from. So because of his continued fight to stop something that is unstop-able we are now not in control. Since it is not being used as. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. While it's technically a review about a political figure (Senator Harry Reid) and not a business, the user is expressing intense frustration and anger. The opening statement (""Senator Harry Reid is a moron!!!""), the -10 star rating, and the accusatory and judgmental language throughout demonstrate a very strong negative sentiment. The detailed rant about Yucca Mountain further emphasizes the reviewer’s negative feelings and perceived detrimental impact of Reid's actions.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: The worst customer service ever. I brought my daughter here to find a dress for a sweet 16 Party. We found a gorgeous dress but unfortunately both ladies ignored . The Lady on the sales floor watched us but never attended to us while the other Lady stayed in the back. Beautiful dresses , however when spending money I'd prefer customer service to be attached to the \""SERVICE\"". \nNO STARS !. Reasoning: The review expresses significant frustration and disappointment with the customer service experience. While acknowledging the dresses were ""gorgeous"" and ""beautiful,"" the overwhelming tone focuses on the dismissive and inattentive behavior of the staff. Phrases like ""worst customer service ever,"" ""ignored,"" ""watched us but never attended,"" and the rating of ""NO STARS"" clearly indicate a highly negative experience. The desire for customer service to be present during spending highlights the core issue and reinforces the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: These people were too stupid to send a bill to the correct address and then after getting the correct address, were too stupid to send me the bill for another FOUR MONTHS. I guess I underestimated how difficult it can be to use a computer to type out a bill and actually mail it out.\n\nAlso, Randy seems to think the best way to have people people pay a bill they've never actually received is to insult them and ask if they're too poor to afford $70. Well, Randy, it's very difficult to pay a bill that you and your client. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly negative. The language is highly critical, using words like ""stupid,"" ""incompetent,"" and ""insult."" The reviewer expresses frustration and sarcasm throughout the entire text, detailing significant errors in billing practices and criticizing the employee's behavior. The tone is accusatory and deeply dissatisfied.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Love it here. Classic Filipino cuisine. ok service average decor. Good star rating for its quality of food.. Reasoning: While the review mentions ""ok service"" and ""average decor,"" the overwhelmingly positive language (""Love it here,"" ""Good star rating"") and explicit praise for the ""quality of food"" strongly indicate a positive overall experience. The criticisms are minor and outweighed by the enthusiastic endorsement of the food.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Auto Unlimited is the worst car dealership I have ever had to deal with. They break the law and the owner is a terrible person. I bought a car that pulled to the right, during the purchase I told the salesman that I would not buy the car if it pulls to the right. So he assured me that they would take care of it. After they looked over the car twice the problem was not fixed and the owner said tough shit I am not helping you. The car also has a DTC for a sensor that came on. Reasoning: The review uses extremely negative language (""worst,"" ""terrible,"" ""tough shit,"" ""lie,"" ""never ever go""). It details illegal activity (""break the law,"" ""against the law""), dishonesty, and a complete failure to resolve a significant vehicle defect.

She ran to get the head nurse. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer details a series of deeply concerning and distressing experiences, including negligence, unprofessional behavior from staff, privacy violations, inadequate care, rude comments, and a significant negative impact on their life (job loss, financial burden). While the reviewer mentions a single positive interaction with an intern, it is overshadowed by the extensive list of complaints and the overall tone of the review is extremely critical and filled with frustration and anger. The fact that the CEO’s response was deemed inadequate further reinforces the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Breakdown of Broadway Pizzeria: \n\nFOOD: \nBroadway Special (Pepperoni, Green Peppers, Mushrooms, Sausage, Meatballs - omitted the olives and onions) - The pizza wasnt bad but it wasnt authentic NYC Pizza. The crust could have been been a little bit more crisp but I think what it really was the topping. It need that cheesey gooey-ness that normally eat when you take a bit and have that cheese string still connected to the slice... and that didnt happen.\n\nSERVICE:\nThe staff was really friendly and always made a point to check with us to make sure we had everything we needed. I did. Reasoning: The review is mixed, but leans negative. While the service is explicitly praised (""staff was really friendly""), the core of the review focuses on the pizza itself, which is described as ""wasn't bad but it wasn't authentic NYC Pizza"" and lacks a key characteristic (cheesey gooey-ness). The awkward pizza serving method also detracts from the experience. The positive comment about service isn't enough to outweigh the critique of the food, which is the primary focus of a pizzeria review.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: We have ordered pizzas from here several times and have always been pleased. Nice Brooklyn-sized slices with fresh ingredients and homemade crust. I've never eaten in the restaurant, but it's always been a great place for takeout.\n\nTonight we thought we'd try something different, so we ordered other items off the menu. My husband had the Italian Combo sandwich, and I had the lasagna. We ordered these as to-go items, and they both traveled well in the takeout containers. The sandwich was flavorful, with fresh bread and a good selection of meat. The lasagna came with a side salad and an. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer explicitly states they have ""always been pleased"" with previous orders and praises the pizza, sandwiches, garlic knots, and portion sizes. While they mention the lasagna wasn't the best they've ever had, they still consider it ""pretty good"" and acknowledge it's better than what they could make themselves. The comparisons to Pizza Hut and Olive Garden further reinforce the positive sentiment. The overall tone is enthusiastic and encouraging.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive

Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive. While the reviewer mentions the distance (""a little far""), this is immediately followed by a strong endorsement of the pizza's quality (""I don't think you can find a better place""). They compare it favorably to places in the East Coast, praise the friendly staff, appreciate the unique drinks offered, and find the price reasonable. The humorous anecdote about his wife’s jealousy further contributes to the positive and lighthearted tone. There are no significant negative aspects mentioned.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive

Reasoning: While the review starts with a somewhat unusual and potentially negative comment about it being a place to find jobs (""Yep, gonna visit this place if you want a job...""), the rest of the review highlights positive aspects. The reviewer specifically mentions the cleanliness, a nice building, helpful staff, and a quick service experience. The initial comment seems less about the establishment itself and more about its role as an employer, and the overall tone leans towards appreciation for the positive attributes observed.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Raul is a really friendly, helpful fellow. He helped me and Walter as we perused the store for something sweet, simple, and just perfect for an anniversary gift for the two of us. Walter and I had been looking at all kinds of things, earrings, chains, pendants, bands, cocktail rings, all kinds of sparkly things. There was glitter in our eyes for days. They have a wonderful selection of rings and all kinds of pretty things. I'm glad we stopped in, although we never did decide what to get. At least we met Raul. He says he'll remember us so. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses enthusiastic language like ""really friendly,"" ""helpful,"" ""wonderful selection,"" and ""awesome.""

It's a \""business center.\"" \n\nI feel that this is very important to mention, because I was very disappointed when I came during my weekend stay in Vegas.

Although, they do sell tobacco if you're into that kind of thing. \n\nNO FOOD COURT. But, why would you want a food court when you can eat at all the delicious food places and. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer acknowledges a large selection of drinks was ""quite impressive,"" this is overshadowed by several significant disappointments: the lack of alcohol and food court (the primary reason for their visit), a large number of issues including unhelpful staff, and the fact that even Costco coupons are not accepted. The overall tone is one of disappointment and frustration, concluding with a definitive statement of preferring another Costco location. The phrase ""pretty depressing"" further emphasizes the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Our son has constant nose bleeds so his pediatrician's office referred us to dr.boyers. we got in for an appointment and we're shocked with the abusive and hostile manner in witch this doctor conducted himself. He was so rude yelling and screaming at our son who is autistic that my wife was contemplating calling the police. Bottom line is dr.boyers was distasteful and a sorry excuse of a doctor. His staff is equally rude aswell.. Reasoning: This review contains extremely strong negative language. Words like ""abusive,"" ""hostile,"" ""rude,"" ""yelling,"" ""screaming,"" ""distasteful,"" and ""sorry excuse"" clearly indicate a highly negative experience. The reviewer also describes a situation involving potential police involvement, further emphasizing the severity of the negative sentiment.

"Review: I really liked him at first......but then I upset him by walking out of the office after 2 hours of waiting and being told \""you are next\"" by his staff. I tried to explain to him on my next visit that I have to leave work to see him and although I completely understand that emergencies (and deliveries!) come up unexpected, I just need to be told the truth by his staff so I can set the right expectations with my boss & with myself (um...pregnant woman in a doctor's office for 2 hours with no food..what?!?). Ever since then. Reasoning: This review expresses overwhelmingly negative sentiment. While the reviewer initially liked the doctor (""I really liked him at first""), the rest of the review details a significant deterioration in their experience. They describe rudeness, a lack of listening, rushed appointments, misdiagnosis, and a perception of the doctor having a large ego. The details about the long wait times and feeling disregarded (especially highlighting the discomfort of a pregnant woman) amplify the negative experience. The concluding statement ""On to the next doctor"" solidifies the negative sentiment and indicates a complete loss of faith in the doctor.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative

I love the roxy brand (the one for the ladies), so I also shop for myself- love love love the dresses and board shorts; we go to Hawaii once a year, so it's the go-to brand for summer styles- the bright colors and catchy prints really defines the beach vibe. My husband also looks for clothing too. \n\nI really don't intend on shopping here, it just. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive. While the reviewer mentions some minor drawbacks (crowding, limited fitting rooms, teenage employees), these are presented as minor inconveniences rather than serious complaints. The enthusiastic language (""love love love,"" ""cool store,"" ""great brands,"" ""excellent clearance prices"") and repeated emphasis on the fantastic sales and specific product enjoyment (Roxy brand) strongly indicate a positive experience. The acknowledgment of regular prices being comparable to other stores is presented as factual rather than a criticism.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive

Reasoning: While the review acknowledges a ""great selection of products,"" the overwhelming majority of the text focuses on extremely negative experiences. The reviewer details a complete lack of customer service, expresses disgust at a cashier’s rude comment, and concludes that poor service is a recurring problem. The reference to a comparison with a more positive experience at another store further emphasizes the negative sentiment. Despite the initial mention of the product selection, the pervasive criticism makes a negative classification warranted.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I'm a fan of LaCoste when I'm in the mood to look preppy with my polos, sweaters, and sundresses. \n\nThis store is tiny in comparison to the other stores I usually frequent. \n\nI didn't find the selection to be all that great, but I did find a really cute shirt to add to my preppy collection.. Reasoning: The review expresses a generally positive sentiment despite mentioning a negative aspect. The reviewer explicitly states they are ""a fan"" of the brand and appreciates the aesthetic. While they note the store is small and the selection wasn't great, the positive takeaway of finding a ""really cute shirt"" outweighs these criticisms. The overall tone suggests enjoyment and satisfaction.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: The best store at these outlets!\n\nStrong selections across the board, everything Nike can be found here and the prices for some of the shoes are amazing.\n\nMy wife purchased some Nike running shoes for 25 bucks... they discounted 10% because there was a tiny speck of dirt on the shoes... that's great service! \n\nThe outlet is bigger than the others and is spaced out very well. Plenty of help from the friendly staff and they ask you if you need help before you have to flag them down. \n\nThe basketball shoes selection is decent, but the bread and butter belongs in. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses enthusiastic language (""The best store,"" ""amazing,"" ""great service,"" ""Yesss!!""), explicitly praises the selection, prices, and staff friendliness. The anecdote about the discount for a tiny speck of dirt highlights excellent customer service. Even the slightly quirky detail about the t-shirt purchase and sleeve-chopping contributes to the overall positive and humorous tone. The final comment about the temperature being preferable to other stores reinforces the positive experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: It's a decent paper with great access to their writers. Plus, I really like the location! (They are located directly next to my office, so whenever I need something...I just walk over) \n\nIt also makes a great filler in my fire pit! Lol. Reasoning: The review expresses several positive aspects. The reviewer explicitly states the paper is ""decent"" and praises the accessibility of the writers and the convenient location (""great access,"" ""really like the location,"" ""just walk over""). While the comment about using it as fire pit filler is humorous and slightly unexpected, it doesn't detract from the overall positive experience. The reviewer's tone is generally favorable.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I've been a customer since 1998. Trying to cancel hardline telephone service in Vegas on a Monday evening. I was on hold for 25 minutes. Then the rep tells me they can't cancel my phone service unless I start paying for the modem or buy a new one. Not renting a modem. Between both homes, I'm shelling out nearly 300 per month. Guess I'll go ahead and cancel ALL my service.in Vegas and Phoenix.. Reasoning: The review expresses significant frustration and dissatisfaction. The customer highlights a lengthy hold time, an unexpected requirement to pay for equipment to cancel service, and an already high monthly bill. The statement ""Guess I'll go ahead and cancel ALL my service"" clearly indicates a negative experience and intent to leave the company.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I love saving money!! I was just browsing, and I did not expect to buy anything. I found a deal that I could not pass up though. I think that they normally have a buy 1 pair get the 2nd pair for half price. I was able to get a pair of shape up shoes for $39.95 and a second pair of shoes for $14.97 (Orig. $44.95)!! \n\nI used my shoes to go hiking at Red Rock Canyon later that week. I haven't used the shape ups yet. I probably won't need another pair of shoes for awhile....but if I. Reasoning: The reviewer expresses clear enthusiasm (""I love saving money!!""). They were pleasantly surprised by a great deal and highlight the significant savings achieved. While they haven’t fully utilized the shoes yet, their overall tone is positive and they indicate a likelihood of returning. This strongly suggests a positive experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: They have a variety of makeup lines but the selection of products was pretty scarce when I went in. The options they have for MAC, which was what I was shopping for, was really limited and most of what they did have was opened, broken, or looked really used. On top of that the customer service was terrible. The three employees working sat behind the register the entire time, no greeting or asking if I needed any help- which I did. Pretty disappointed. I'll be going to the indoor location next, hopefully there's a little more options.. Reasoning: This review expresses significant disappointment and frustration. While acknowledging a variety of makeup lines, the reviewer details numerous negative experiences: a scarce selection, damaged/used products, and exceptionally poor customer service. The phrases ""pretty scarce,"" ""opened, broken, or looked really used,"" and ""terrible"" clearly indicate a negative experience. The concluding statement of seeking a better experience elsewhere reinforces this negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Although this store is often mobbed with people, I still don't mind sifting through the masses to find a killer deal. The best part is that they hand out coupons as you walk in. The coupons range from 30% to 50% off usually. This visit I was handed a 50% off coupon on handbags. If you like Coach, you'll love this outlet store.. Reasoning: The review acknowledges a negative aspect (""often mobbed with people""), but immediately frames it as a worthwhile trade-off for ""killer deals."" The enthusiastic tone regarding the coupons (""best part,"" ""handed a 50% off coupon"") and the direct recommendation (""If you like Coach, you'll love this outlet store"") strongly indicate a positive experience overall. The reviewer focuses on the benefits and seems genuinely happy with their experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: This outlet location is okay. I liked that they had mens, womens, and kids clothes. I went during winter and they had a good amount of sweaters and jackets. The prices were reasonable but the store was pretty disorganized. Not a bad place to shop if you already know what you're looking for.. Reasoning: The review contains both positive and negative elements. The reviewer appreciates the variety of clothing and reasonable prices, which are positive aspects. However, they also note the store being ""pretty disorganized."" The overall tone is tempered and lacks strong enthusiasm or disappointment. The phrase ""okay"" and the conditional statement ""Not a bad place to shop *if* you already know what you're looking for"" indicate a generally unremarkable experience.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: Staff at this facility are outstanding. The online registration was convenient and easy to complete. Eliminated the stress of sitting in the facility trying to remember the information. Registration was simple..the nursing staff was very helpful and considerate. From check in to check out- everyone was pleasant and professional.. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""outstanding,"" ""convenient and easy,"" ""helpful and considerate,"" ""pleasant and professional"" clearly indicate a highly favorable experience. There are no negative comments or criticisms present.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: This place is overstaffed, and in fact right when you walk in there is no warm welcome to the store. Everyone who works there is busy. Sadly my experience here was dissapointing because they didn't have what I was looking for. \n\nThe store seems to be under construction. There was a bum in the music section just playing his little heart out on the piano, all intoxicated. (felt uncomfy)\n\nThere is no variety of product. Service is poor.. Reasoning: The review contains overwhelmingly negative language. Phrases like ""disappointing,"" ""no warm welcome,"" ""poor service,"" and mentions of being ""uncomfy"" due to an intoxicated individual create a strongly negative impression. While the observation about overstaffing might seem minor, it points to operational issues contributing to the poor overall experience. The description of the store being under construction also adds to the negative environment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Back after a few months and they still can't get these Americanos right . How hard is it?. Reasoning: The review expresses disappointment and frustration (""still can't get these Americanos right,"" ""How hard is it?""). The phrasing indicates a persistent problem and a questioning tone that suggests dissatisfaction. This points to a negative experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I never knew how incompetent they were till I tried another doctor...My insurance changed so I had to go down the street to another doctor for the yearly exam.. I'm 50 years and have started to wear progressive lenses as well as contacts. I spent thousands of dollars with these crooks on eye exams as well as contacts and glasses. Come to find out, I was given a prescription that wasn't even near what it should have been! FOR YEARS No wonder why I couldn't see! My daughter who went to a new doctor in RENO, the same thing. The. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer uses extremely strong, derogatory language (""crooks,"" ""crap,"" ""incompetent"") to describe the practice and staff. They detail significant issues with incorrect prescriptions, poor product quality (glasses falling apart), and a dismissive attitude toward addressing those problems. The comparison to Walmart reading glasses highlights their frustration with the expensive, purportedly high-quality product they received. The desire for the practice to go bankrupt is a clear indicator of intense dissatisfaction.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Wow. The receptionist here is RUDE. I am not even visiting the doctor. I'm here with my grandma who is seeing the doctor. They were rude to her on the phone when she called, telling her that she would probably have to wait a very long time because Mondays are horribly busy in a way to make her feel bad. That rubbed me the wrong way. Why not inform her that there might be a wait rather than make her feel bad about it? \n\nOnce we got here, she didn't even have to wait. The only people in the waiting. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer explicitly describes the receptionist as ""RUDE"" and details several instances of unprofessional and inappropriate behavior – rudeness on the phone, deliberately making a patient feel bad about wait times, and making threatening remarks to a client within earshot of other patients. While the reviewer acknowledges a potential positive with the doctor (""I hope this doctor is worth...""), this is overshadowed by the intensely negative portrayal of the receptionist. The low star rating (2 stars, intending to give 1) reinforces the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: My friends and I wanted to indulge in kid-like fun yesterday so we stopped by here around 9:00 pm. Since it was one hour before closing the rides, the slide, and three of the four tracks were closed, which is understandable. Luckily we were able to squeeze in two quick races at the Sprint Kart track. Each game was $7.00 each. Each race lasted about 15 minutes each, but it felt much longer! The inside where all the arcade games and the food court area was looked a little run down and dingy though.. Reasoning: The review expresses a mixed experience. While the reviewer acknowledges the closures were understandable given the time, the disappointment of limited activities is evident. The comment about the arcade and food court being ""run down and dingy"" is a significant negative. The positive aspect is the ability to squeeze in two races, but the subjective feeling that the races ""felt much longer"" suggests the overall experience wasn't particularly enjoyable. The combination of disappointment and a negative description leans the review towards a slightly negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Took my two boys here (ages 8 & 9) on their spring break. It wasn't very crowded, which was nice. We purchased 4 \""1 hour ride\"" passes for $22/each.\n\nThe employees were slow moving. Wasting our time, walking and working at a tortoises pace. My son stood in line to ride the solo cars, he was well over the red line; at least an inch over yet was told her was \""too short\"" and not allowed to ride. \n\nThe food was exactly what you would expect, greasy and over priced. \n\nWe had fun, but this place could be a lot better. Reasoning: The review presents a mixed bag of experiences. While the reviewer states they ""had fun,"" this is tempered by several significant criticisms. These include complaints about slow and inefficient employees, a frustrating height restriction incident, and overpriced, typical amusement park food. The positive mention of the lack of crowds is overshadowed by the negative aspects. The concluding statement that the place ""could be a lot better"" reinforces the overall sense of dissatisfaction.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: My family went there for dinner for the first time tonight and it was a TERRIBLE experience. The service and the overall presentation of the restaurant were decent. The food, however, was so bad that everyone got a stomach ache. I think we all had food poisoning. The food was also either bland or very salty. We did not try the Mongolian grill section, so I cannot speak on behalf of that. Will I go back, no.. Reasoning: The review uses extremely negative language (""TERRIBLE,"" ""so bad,"" ""food poisoning""). While acknowledging decent service and presentation, the overwhelmingly negative experience with the food and the resulting illness clearly dominate the review. The concluding statement ""Will I go back, no"" seals the negative classification.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: This store was pretty clean and had some pretty good deals, especially with several racks of red tag clearance items this past weekend. I had an issue with the checkout process, however, which is why I can't give them 4 stars. For buying only 2 items we were at the registers for what felt like 15 min because the associate couldn't figure out how to scan my items. I guess one of the stickers was messed up and wouldn't scan correctly....but rather than go and grab another one that had a good tag or manually key in the sku or. Reasoning: The review presents a mixed experience. While the reviewer praises the store's cleanliness and good deals, the significant negative experience with the checkout process (lengthy wait, associate's handling of the scanning issue) heavily impacts their overall impression. The reviewer explicitly states they can't give 4 stars *because* of this issue. While they offer a possible explanation (new employee) and express hope for improvement, the frustration is evident. This balance of positive and negative aspects leans towards a slightly negative overall sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: One star minus one star = zero stars!! Please let me help you if you are thinking about eating here: DONT! I am an avid connesieur of buffets and this place is a hot mess!! I was put off immediately by the uncleanliness but we proceeded, watered down crab, amnesia salad made with mayonnaise, mushy food all around...don't eat here ever, waste of money! They have a sign that says they wool. Reasoning: The review uses extremely negative language (""zero stars,"" ""hot mess,"" ""uncleanliness,"" ""watered down,"" ""waste of money""). The reviewer explicitly advises against visiting and expresses disgust with multiple aspects of the buffet. The tone is overwhelmingly critical and conveys a very poor experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: This place doesn't even deserve one star! It is absolutely disgusting! Myself and my guest both got food poisoning from this place! We went there on April 25, 2013. Our sickness lasted for days! Everything on the buffet was old, dried out and room temperature. And omg....the bathrooms....wow!!!! Absolutely disgusting! The entire place was filthy. I knew we should have walked out immediately! Just from the smell inside the place. Whatever you do.....remember....you are taking a very very big chance if you eat here! I think it would be more likely than not....that you will end up sick! We actually. Reasoning: The review uses extremely negative language throughout, including words like ""disgusting,"" ""filthy,"" and ""absolutely."" It details a severe negative experience (food poisoning) for the reviewer and their guest, coupled with descriptions of unsanitary conditions. The strong recommendation to avoid the establishment and the call for it to be shut down further solidify the intensely negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: When I first came here I was amazed by how much food they were serving. It is a usual buffet so you can go and pick out which food you want to eat. They have many different varieties to choose from and they are all in their own section. The place was nice, clean, and their food signs really catch your attention. If you're a person who is really hungry and is craving many different kinds of food then I would definitely suggest this place for you. You can even bring your family if you wish as their buffet prices. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""amazed,"" ""nice,"" ""clean,"" ""definitely suggest,"" and ""have not regretted"" clearly indicate a positive experience. The reviewer highlights the variety of food, cleanliness, reasonable prices, and the ability to bring family, all contributing to a favorable impression. The repeated visits (3 or 4 times) further solidify the positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: My mom treated us for my daughter's birthday here since it wasn't too far from my brother's home. This was probably my least favorite of the Chinese buffets my mom has taken us to the past couple years.\n\nThe service was not too bad, but the selection wasn't as good as it could be and the foot just not as tasty. Some foods seemed to have been sitting there for awhile, therefore, things that should be soft were hard.\n\nIt just wasn't as tasty as Krazy Buffet or the ones in the Phx area that we like. The place had a nice. Reasoning: The review expresses significant disappointment. While the reviewer acknowledges the ambiance was nice and thanks their mom for the treat, the overwhelming focus is on the negative aspects: the food wasn't tasty, some food seemed old and hard, and it wasn't as good as other buffets they've experienced. The concluding statement ""The taste just didn't make this place appealing to me to go back"" solidifies the negative sentiment. While there's a mention of decent service, the negative comments outweigh this.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: 4 years later, this place is still terrible. Why my mom likes to go here, ill never understand.. Reasoning: The review explicitly states the place is ""terrible"" and expresses confusion/disagreement with someone else's positive opinion (""Why my mom likes to go here, ill never understand.""). This indicates a strongly negative experience and opinion.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: My dad took his small Maltese here a few months ago and it was the worst experience ever! First of all his haircut was awful and they only accepted cash. But the worst thing is that our dog was traumatized! He was shaking the whole day and started limping as if he had been beaten. He also had some small cuts and was not his playful self. We almost took him to the vet but decided to wait to see if he would get better. The shaking stopped the next day but he limped for couple days. I don't know. Reasoning: This review expresses extreme dissatisfaction and distress. The language is overwhelmingly negative, using words like ""worst,"" ""awful,"" ""traumatized,"" ""beaten,"" ""hurt,"" and ""be careful."" The detailed description of the dog's injuries and distressed behavior paints a very negative picture of the experience. The mention of potential veterinary intervention and the complaint about cash-only payment further reinforces the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Took a few different dogs here while we were fostering and the first time they did great. We took our dog back to get another haircut and they didn't do it anything like the first. We took him back a 3rd time and told them about the great job they did on the first go-around and asked them to replicate it. They didn't. They made a lot of notes on our card and when we brought him back a 4th time, they flat out told us to leave and said \""we weren't a good fit\"". The owner was practically hysterical,. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer acknowledges a positive initial experience (""they did great the first time""), the subsequent experiences were consistently poor and culminated in being essentially dismissed by the owner. The language used is highly critical: ""didn't do it anything like the first,"" ""huge mistake,"" and the description of the owner's behavior as ""hysterical"" are all strong indicators of a deeply unsatisfactory experience. The finality of the statements – refusing to return, refusing to recommend – further reinforces the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: It's not the Rio buffet, but it's fine for what it is: a decent salad and soup bar, especially at $6.49 a person. I'm not sure what the previous reviewer expected for that price.\n\nFour soups, several pastas, and lots of salad items, plus pizza and potatoes. Mushrooms could've been fresher, and soft serve was too soft. On the other hand soft drinks (extra $) had free refills and you could take a refill with you.. Reasoning: The review expresses a generally accepting, if not enthusiastic, tone. While there are a few criticisms (mushrooms not fresh, soft serve too soft), these are presented as minor issues and balanced by the positive aspects like the affordable price, variety of options (soups, salads, pastas, pizza, potatoes), and the free refills on drinks. The concluding sentence, “you could take a refill with you” is a small, but positive, detail. The reviewer's comment about previous reviewer's expectations indicates they view the establishment as meeting expectations for the price point.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: Ulta is quickly overtaking my love of Sephora since it is so much closer and so easily assisible. They are also beginning to carry more high end brands like Lancome and Benefit. I like that they have a better selection of salon hair products as well as the drugstore brands. NYX is sold here and often goes on sale for buy one get one half off. If you're a follower of beauty blogs you can appreciate the NYX brand as an inexpensive beauty find. This particular store is huge, which allows for plenty of room to meander and shop. The. Reasoning: The review expresses overwhelmingly positive feelings towards Ulta. The reviewer explicitly states Ulta is ""quickly overtaking"" their love of Sephora, praises the store's convenience, expanding high-end brand selection, better hair product variety, and mentions a great deal on a popular brand (NYX). They also appreciate the store's size and positive staff interactions. There are no negative comments to detract from this enthusiastic assessment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: As usual Burger King is out of ketchup!! I wish I could give it some negative stars. The worst thing is that I've been to at least four other burger king's and have had the same problem with the ketchup, but I guess that's not as bad as the time when they ran outta buns!! You run a burger joint; how are you going to run out of the two essential things to run a burger joint?! Plus the bun is always two sizes too big for the patty. Just have sloppy made burgers. Worst chain ever!!!!. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer expresses extreme frustration and disappointment multiple times using phrases like ""negative stars,"" ""worst chain ever,"" and emphasizing repeated issues (lack of ketchup and buns). The tone is angry and critical, focusing on significant operational failures that directly impact the core experience of eating at Burger King.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I actually really like this Ulta location - the people are always super friendly, it's not crazy busy, even on the weekends, and it's close to home. But after having two of the worst brow waxing experiences of my life at this ulta location, I can't in good conscience return and the 2 star rating is more than deserved.\n\nI recently moved to Vegas from Chicago where I was spoiled with the BEST brow waxers, ever!! So when I came to town, I started looking around for somewhere to make my new brow home. I came into this location by chance. Reasoning: While the reviewer initially expresses a positive sentiment towards the Ulta location (friendly staff, convenient location, not too busy), the overwhelming majority of the review details multiple, severely negative experiences with their brow waxing services. The reviewer’s frustration is palpable and they explicitly state their brows are ""ruined"" and they will not return. The positive aspects are completely overshadowed by the multiple negative encounters and the significant disappointment expressed.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: LOW LOW PRICES!! TODAY!! \n\nActually every day. \n\nYou're not going to Thai Grill for the atmosphere unless you really miss the atmosphere of your Grandpa's basement rec room. Light brown paneling rules the day here and it is completed by a couple TV's sitting up on a cabinet or table and red vinyl booths accented by occasional touches of almost matching duct tape. All it needed was a furnace, water heater and peg board wall filled with tools and the Grandpa's basement Thai restaurant illusion would be complete. \n\nSo what about the food you ask? Is this a legit hole-in-the. Reasoning: This review presents a mixed bag. The reviewer is *extremely* enthusiastic about the price (""LOW LOW PRICES!!""), which is a strong positive. However, they dedicate a significant portion of the review to describing the incredibly dated and frankly depressing decor, using humor to highlight its shortcomings. The food itself receives a ""decent but not outstanding"" assessment, with both positives (flavorful sauce, no curry flakes) and negatives (oddly cut veggies, chewy shrimp). The Thai iced tea preference and the mention of repeat customers are positive signals. The final comment about the security guard patrolling the lot introduces a slightly unsettling note,. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: At first glance, the restaurant seems to be pretty well built with a. lot of nice, casual tables. Empty tables, except for the staff eating in the dining room. The first thing that catches my eye is the glass of water, lots of random floating white bits. This is not your usual dirty glass mind you, there were a substantial number of things on my glass and of my companion's glass.\n\nWe ordered a Thai Iced Tea since the water was no good. Fortunately this was clean, and tasted pretty good.\n\nFor entrees, we got Chicken Phad Thai, Pan Nang Beef, and. Reasoning: The review presents a mixed bag of observations. While the restaurant's initial appearance is noted positively (""pretty well built,"" ""nice, casual tables""), the immediately negative experience with the water (""lots of random floating white bits"") sets a concerning tone. The Thai Iced Tea being clean is a small relief. The food itself has a varied quality - the Phad Thai is deemed ""decent"" and a good value, but the Pan Nang Beef is heavily criticized for being poorly made and overly greasy. The Screaming Tiger is described as ""decent."" The final assessment is ""mediocre,"" and the price isn't highlighted as. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: Geek squad sucks, no customer service, no order or organization, horrible communication. Reasoning: The review uses strongly negative language (""sucks,"" ""horrible"") and lists multiple serious complaints about customer service, organization, and communication. There are no positive aspects mentioned.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I ordered the basil fried rice. When I got home and opened it It was just regular fried rice. I took a look at the menu again just to be sure and it did say that the basil fried rice only had basil, onions, and chili. My rice had tons of carrots, onions, broccoli and no basil. I called to complain and the guy told me his wife says she put basil in it. I mentioned that on the menu it doesnt say any of the vegetables came in it and I didnt want it. He pretty much waited me. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer acknowledges the large shrimp and gives two stars, the vast majority of the review details significant issues: incorrect order (basil fried rice not as described), soggy crab puffs, a frustrating and dismissive response from the restaurant when the order error was brought up, a surprise tip added to the bill, and a generally ""horrible experience."" The tone is consistently disappointed and frustrated. The small positive regarding the shrimp doesn't outweigh the substantial negativity.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: The couple time I have come into this store have been for fish gear. I bought a small aquarium, gravel, a net, some tank decorations, gold fish food, water treatment and a few comet goldfish. Supply on hand is limited but the prices have been fair and even cheaper than Walmart in some cases. But the friendliness of the staff has been hit and miss. While wondering the isles I was passed by a few employees without so much as a howdoyoudo. I was standing at the fish section looking at what would become my future pets and nobody offered. Reasoning: This review presents a mixed bag of experiences, making a clear-cut positive or negative classification difficult. The reviewer praises the prices (""fair and even cheaper than Walmart"") and acknowledges the staff ultimately correcting a mistake with the fish selection. However, the core of the experience revolves around a significant lack of customer service – employees ignoring the reviewer, a transactional fish selection with no assistance, and a general lack of friendliness from most staff. The positive elements are outweighed by the negative service experiences, creating a generally unfavorable impression.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: My mother-in-law sent us a package for Christmas and now we are hooked. I hated how long it took to deliver though so we found a store on Rainbow in Las Vegas NV. They honored all of the deals found on line. This is the best meat and deserts I've ever had. Lasagna is great too. Highly recommend.. Reasoning: While the reviewer expresses frustration with the delivery time (""I hated how long it took to deliver though""), the overwhelming majority of the review is extremely positive. They explicitly state they are ""hooked,"" describe the food as ""the best meat and deserts I've ever had,"" praise the lasagna, and finish with a ""Highly recommend."" The negative comment about delivery is outweighed by the enthusiastic praise of the product and the in-store experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Petsmart on Decatur. \nMy husband and I always went to the Petsmart on the east coast so we decided to take our babies to the Petsmart here in Vegas where we moved to. At first they were all polite. Elsa would cut my himmilayian cat\n{The lion Cut} and Wendy would cut my pommerian {the lion cut} I saw a lady that had color on her baby so I decided to get it for my Pom. First color was purple. We got it on her tail. It was very fashionable. They always put a bow in her hair. The 2nd time\nI. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative despite some initially positive experiences. While the reviewer mentions polite staff and a previous manager (Betty) resolving an issue with a refund/free cut, the core of the review focuses on a very poor grooming experience, a lack of accountability from the groomer Wendy, a dismissive response from Elsa (who was apparently a manager at one point), and ultimately, the reviewer’s decision to never return. The language used expresses frustration (""sloppy,"" ""pissed,"" ""did a S....y job""), disappointment, and a sense of being ignored. The concluding statement, ""I will never bring my babies back,"" solidifies the negative. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Nice, fashionable clothing at affordable pricing just like any other Old Navy/Gap store. This store appears to be larger and better maintained than others I've been to. The employees are very friendly and helpful and there are always many of them around the store so it isn't hard to flag someone down if you need help. The cashiers at the front are quick and efficient, but expect a line if there's a good sale going on. This was the case the last time I was here.. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""nice,"" ""affordable,"" ""better maintained,"" ""friendly and helpful,"" ""quick and efficient"" all indicate a positive experience. While the mention of a line during sales is a minor drawback, it's presented as an expected consequence of a good sale rather than a significant negative. The comparison to other Old Navy/Gap stores, highlighting this one as ""better,"" further reinforces the positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Every Pick Up Stix is the same, so I knew what I was getting when I picked up food here: very tasty Chinese food. I think their \""House Special Chicken\"" is unlike any other Chinese dish, so I usually get that. Mixed with rice, that easily makes two meals for me. While the food is good here, though, it's nothing amazing. And I much prefer ordering from an independent Chinese restaurant, so I don't come here that often. Definitely a top choice when shopping in \""Best In The West\"" and want to grab a meal after.. Reasoning: The review presents a mixed bag of opinions. While the reviewer explicitly states the food is ""very tasty"" and praises the ""House Special Chicken,"" they also temper this with phrases like ""nothing amazing"" and a preference for independent restaurants. The comment about it making two meals is a practical positive. The concluding statement about it being a good choice when shopping in a specific area indicates convenience and reliability, not necessarily exceptional quality. Overall, the positive aspects are balanced by the reservations and preference for alternatives.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: Love this place! Awesome food, something for everyone. You can order items to be spicy to very mild. The yellow chicken curry is to die for and so is the beef jerky. Always friendly and you can eat family style if you get several different items and share. Always busy weather it is lunch or dinner. I like to order over the phone and take out. They even know me by name & order. Could eat here every nite!. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""Love this place!"", ""Awesome food,"" ""to die for,"" ""Always friendly,"" and ""Could eat here every nite!"" clearly indicate a highly favorable experience.

"Review: OK, so living in Las Vegas has taken some getting used to. Especially the whole strip mall thing, which means lack of character to the shopping areas. \n\nSo imagine my surprise when looking for a place to have dinner with out of town friends, that we pulled into a parking spot in front of Pin Kaow and walked through the doors and were transported into a beautifully elegant, dining experience.\n\nNot only is the restaurant beautiful, the staff is friendly, attentive, dressed in Thai attire. And the food... OH! The food. It's wonderfully delicious! My party and I had assorted curries. Reasoning: The review expresses overwhelmingly positive feelings. While the reviewer initially acknowledges a negative aspect of Las Vegas (the strip mall aesthetic), this is quickly overshadowed by enthusiastic praise for Pin Kaow. Words like ""beautifully elegant,"" ""friendly,"" ""attentive,"" ""wonderfully delicious,"" and phrases like ""little ray of sunshine"" clearly indicate a highly favorable experience. The anecdote about the San Diego friend wanting the duck curry again reinforces the exceptional quality.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I have to say that I think I am over it. I am from LA originally, and maybe I have just been spoiled by really good and cheap Thai food. When I moved to Vegas, this was my go to Thai spot, partly because someone recommended it and partly because there was not much else to choose from in our area. Pin Kaow has some decent tasting food, but my biggest problem is that I feel like the portion sizes are getting smaller, and it is just not worth the price.. Reasoning: The review expresses disappointment and frustration. While the reviewer acknowledges the food is ""decent tasting"" and was once a go-to spot, the overall tone is negative due to complaints about shrinking portion sizes and the feeling that the food isn't worth the price anymore. The phrasing ""I am over it"" is a strong indicator of a negative experience. The comparison to LA Thai food further reinforces the disappointment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I guess I will write reviews of places I really like too because I think some of my reviews are being Yelp \""filtered\"". I used to like this place, the food and the service. The food is okay. I have had better thai food however this is a convenient location for me. \n \nThe last 2 times I have been in I have been ignored for a while by service. I am sure it wasn't on purpose but when 2 tables are seated after me and served drinks and their appetizers before the server acknowledges me, that is a problem.. Reasoning: This review presents a mixed bag of opinions, ultimately leaning negative. While the reviewer mentions previously liking the place and appreciating the hostess, the core of the review focuses on increasingly poor service – being ignored and feeling overlooked. The repeated instances of poor service, culminating in walking out once and waving for attention the other time, strongly indicate a negative experience. The statement ""I won't be back unless friends have a burning desire to go"" is a definitive sign of dissatisfaction. The mention of a new, closer Thai restaurant further reinforces the negative sentiment, implying they are actively seeking. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Back in the day I used to come here a lot and since I was on this side of town I decided to stop by for lunch just like old times. The flavor of the food is still good and the staff is still pleasant. My only bad comment is that I swear their lunch portions got smaller, Just look at the picture I posted of the beef and broccoli, the scoop of rice is appropriate but c'mon, look at the main entree, it's too small. Like I said, I know it's lunch time but at other restaurants, you will. Reasoning: While the reviewer expresses nostalgia and acknowledges the good flavor and pleasant staff, the primary focus is a complaint about the reduced portion sizes. The repeated emphasis on the small portion (""it's too small,"" ""at other restaurants, you will and do get larger portions"") outweighs the positive comments. The tone is mildly disappointed rather than overwhelmingly negative, but the central critique makes it lean towards a negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: My family LOVES Thai food. When we stepped through the door for the first time at Pin Kaow this past week, we were in awe of how cozy and beautifully decorated this restaurant was on the inside. Here is what we ordered (our Thai favorites) and the consensus we came to on our overall experience:\n\n1. Tom Ka Kai soup ( A lemongrass soup with coconut milk, mushrooms , and chicken)\nIt was rich and delicious with just the right balance of flavors.. but extremely salty.. so much so we could not finish. Had it not been so salty.. I think it. Reasoning: While the reviewer expresses initial excitement (""LOVES Thai food,"" ""in awe"" of the decor) and clearly states enjoyment of some aspects, the overwhelming feedback revolves around significant negative issues: excessive saltiness in two dishes, small portions, and a feeling of being ""stingy."" The final sentence, ""We've decided to keep looking,"" explicitly indicates a lack of satisfaction and a search for an alternative. The positive elements are overshadowed by these criticisms.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Chili's is usually our go to spot for a nice quick meal and maragritas which are awesome. Our last visit however was pretty disappointing. We ordered our usual, cajun chicken pasta. When we got our meal, which was a longer wait than usual, it tasted very salty! So we asked the server for a side of alfredo sauce. It took them even longer just for a side of sauce. Finally when we got the sauce, put it on our food, it was cold! So we just gave up on our meal and asked for our check, also advising our server. Reasoning: While the review starts positively mentioning Chili's as a usual spot and praising the margaritas, the vast majority of the review details a significantly negative experience. The customer explicitly states disappointment, describes issues with the food (too salty, cold sauce), long waits, and highlights the server’s lack of concern or attempt to rectify the situation (no apology, no discount). The concluding statement about the unexpected service reinforces the negative impression. The initial positive comment is overshadowed by the numerous negative points raised.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Crappy service. Good food..... Ordered, then got food 50mins Later then didn't see the Waitress for another 30 mins..... When she dropped off the check.... Reasoning: While the reviewer acknowledges the food was ""good,"" the overwhelming tone focuses on extremely negative experiences with the service. Phrases like ""Crappy service,"" ""50 mins Later,"" and ""didn't see the Waitress for another 30 mins"" highlight significant issues and frustration. The single positive comment is overshadowed by the litany of complaints.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I have been here twice. A couple months ago I was looking through my Entertainment Book for ideas of what to do on a Saturday. I saw the coupon for Artful Potter and asked my spouse if she wanted to check it out. She was up for it, so we headed over.\n\nI didn't quite know what to expect. When we got there a lady said to pick out a piece and then she'd explain how everything works. I picked out a hippopotamus bank and my wife got two little plates. We sat down and the lady explained how to paint. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive. The author explicitly states they ""really had a good time,"" their wife wants to return monthly, and both the author's mother and aunt were pleased despite initial reluctance. The author also offers a direct recommendation (""definitely recommend checking it out""), which is a strong indicator of positive sentiment. While the initial uncertainty (""I didn't quite know what to expect"") doesn's detract from the overall enthusiastic experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Food was okay, service was fine.. but got serious diarrhea shortly after leaving there (both of us did)... same thing happened last time we were there also. The first time I wrote it off as a fluke, could have caught that bug elsewhere.. but two times? Health Department is failing us here, and so is Tony Roma's.. Reasoning: The review contains overwhelmingly negative language despite the initial ""okay"" and ""fine."" The primary focus is on a severe negative health consequence (diarrhea) experienced by the reviewer and another person after eating at the restaurant, and the fact that this has happened repeatedly. The direct accusation of the Health Department failing and blaming Tony Roma's solidifies the negative sentiment. Even the initial neutral descriptions are overshadowed by the health concerns raised.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: THE BEST!!!!! Moved here from Cali, and this is one of the first places my sweetie took me to. Great service, AMAZING food, (better then what Ventura has to offer) clean, and affordable.\nFamily is coming in next week and I can't wait to take them here, yet sweetie is afraid they will never leave after they taste the delisiousness of this place! \nGO! You won't be disapointed!. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Words like ""BEST,"" ""AMAZING,"" ""sweetie"" (conveys affection), ""clean,"" ""affordable,"" and phrases like ""better then what Ventura has to offer"" and ""delisiousness"" clearly indicate a very favorable experience. The enthusiastic recommendation (""GO! You won't be disapointed!"") seals the positive classification.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: My sisters and I have been coming here constantly for the first week of my stay in Vegas. We were obsessed with the Mexican food for a while. I ended up actually liking tacos and the horchata and the burritos, but for some reason we just stopped going here. It was bomb af for a while, but then I guess I got more of this goodness in such little time.\n\nThere were flies everywhere that kept following my food, which made me sad..since I had to move around the whole restaurant to try to avoid them. Mostly in the afternoon lol.\n\nI. Reasoning: This review presents a complex mix of feelings. Initially, the reviewer expresses strong positive sentiment (""obsessed,"" ""bomb af"") and enjoyment of the food. However, the experience significantly deteriorates due to recurring issues with flies and, crucially, a severely negative interaction with a staff member (""a bitchhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh tho!""). The staff interaction, complete with aggressive behavior (throwing a bag), is a significant negative. While the initial positive food experience tempers the overall sentiment, the negative experiences outweigh it.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: We were excited to try Pepes carne asada fries as they advertise the best in Vegas!\nWe walked in to no greet as an employee mopped the.floor and the cook looked at us didn't say anything disappeared we waited for someone to come to take our order finally another lady comes out to do so. I didn't like how you can't see much of the cooking taking place.\n\nHighly disappointed we wasted over half of our food there were no beans as another user said bland guacamole no pico de gayo and CANNED CHEESE SAUCE!!! You've got to be kidding me!! There. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment multiple times (""Highly disappointed,"" ""wasted""), details numerous issues with the service (lack of greeting, disappearing cook, delayed order taking), and criticizes the food quality severely (bland guacamole, canned cheese sauce, lack of advertised ingredients). The comparison to Roberto's, presented as vastly superior, reinforces the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I LOVE MEXICANS.... I MEAN MEXICAN FOOD!\n\nPepe's compared to Roberto's. \n\nPepe's knocks this one out of the ball park. The reason being the quality of food is way better. I want it to be known that the staff here is very friendly, maybe a little to friendly I had a guy in the back winking at me.\nAlso the first time I was here one of the employees actually asked me for my number, at that time (2010) I was single and to this day I still talk to him as a good friend.\n\nOverall you can order anything with the carne. Reasoning: While the opening line is awkward and potentially problematic, the rest of the review overwhelmingly expresses enthusiasm and satisfaction with Pepe's. The reviewer explicitly states they ""LOVE"" the food, praises the quality of the carne asada, highlights friendly staff, and recounts a positive, ongoing friendship formed with a former employee. The minor suggestion about the salsa station is a very minor critique and doesn’t detract from the overall positive tone. The positive aspects significantly outweigh any initial concerns.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: First came here years ago with my mom and sister after leaving a club. We were drunk but remember it being delicious. Came back a week ago now that I moved back up to this side of town and it is still the same. Great authentic food, a nice salsa bar in the middle, Coca-Cola products (THANK YOU!)...and decent sized dining room. Great prices. I'll be back!. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""delicious,"" ""great authentic food,"" ""THANK YOU!"" (expressing gratitude), ""great prices,"" and the enthusiastic declaration ""I'll be back!"" all indicate a positive experience. The initial mention of being drunk is framed in a way that doesn't detract from the positive impression of the food.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: My husband found a dog in bad shape late Saturday night, so I needed a vet that was open on Sundays. I found Lone Mountain Animal Hospital through a Yelp search, and they fit me in to their tight Sunday schedule. The entire office worked hard to make my nervous and timid new friend feel safe and at home. Dr. Beckes was gentle and so sweet. Nice clean office, fair pricing and good staff. Thank you!. Reasoning: This review expresses overwhelmingly positive sentiment. The reviewer explicitly thanks the hospital and staff, highlights their willingness to accommodate an urgent situation (""fit me in""), praises the staff's care and Dr. Beckes's gentle nature, and notes positive aspects like a clean office and fair pricing. The language used is appreciative and conveys a sense of relief and gratitude.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: this ross is beyond rude! will not be shopping here again!. Reasoning: The review uses highly negative language (""beyond rude"") and expresses a definitive refusal to return (""will not be shopping here again""). This clearly indicates a very negative experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I'm not sure if this is the exact Ross location that we went to, but we had a great time shopping at Ross. If you want to shop here, make sure you're in the mood to dig through lots of clothing! That's what we did, and we came out with some great bargains. I got an adorable pair of shoes for $10, among other things. It's not well-organized at all, so make sure you search for your size, and don't trust the little signs on the racks with the size numbers!. Reasoning: While the review mentions the store isn't well-organized and cautions shoppers to expect some searching, the overall tone is positive. The reviewer explicitly states they ""had a great time,"" highlights finding ""great bargains,"" and mentions acquiring ""adorable"" items at a low price. The organizational issues are presented as a characteristic to be aware of, rather than a major complaint. The positive experiences outweigh the negative comment about organization.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I normally go to the casino spas but after researching prices I came upon this place. Their prices were much better and I could get alot more for my money so I decided to try it. The staff was very nice. I got the 50/50 massage and facial. The facial was great...what a treat! The massage was also nice but don't waste your money on upgrades such as the scalp massage. They don't spend enough time on it to warrant the extra cost. If you are a local or you just want to be pampered without all the frills this. Reasoning: The review presents a mixed bag of experiences. The reviewer explicitly praises the value for money, the staff's friendliness, and particularly enjoys the facial (""what a treat!""). However, they also mention an unnecessary upgrade and ultimately state a preference for the more luxurious casino spas and indicate they likely won't return. While there are positive aspects, the concluding preference for another establishment and the ""won't go back"" comment temper the overall positive feeling. This suggests a generally favorable, but ultimately not overwhelmingly positive, experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I've been going to Dr Auto since 2001 when Dave, and then Mike, ran an honest, reliable, and fair shop. I never felt like I was being taken advantage of, or upsold on services and/or products I did not need. I have taken all of my cars there for repairs for 10 years and have spent over $50k in that time. I don't believe in car payments, so I buy all my vehicles at auction, or fixer uppers. The guys at Dr Auto took care of all my needs and at no time did I ever feel taken advantage of.\nAll. Reasoning: This review presents a complex mix of past positive experiences and current negative ones. The reviewer explicitly praises the shop's integrity and honesty under previous management (Dave and Mike), highlighting their loyalty and significant investment over many years. However, the core of the review expresses strong disappointment and distrust stemming from recent changes in management and mechanics. The reviewer uses phrases like ""no longer trust,"" ""not recommend,"" and directly calls out a shift towards prioritizing profit over integrity. While acknowledging the difficulty of making negative comments, the ultimate conclusion is unequivocally negative due to the loss of trust. The shift. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: It was a fast smog check..... But on the banner it says accepts all coupons. I brought a 9.99 coupon from purrfect auto. The guy there says he does not take the 9.99 coupons but will do it for 15!! Wtf! Last time I checked that was an any coupon!!!!!!. Reasoning: The review starts with a mildly positive comment about the speed of the smog check. However, the overwhelming tone is negative due to the blatant contradiction regarding coupon acceptance. The reviewer expresses frustration and disbelief (""Wtf!"") about being denied a coupon they believed was valid and then pressured to pay a higher price. This indicates a negative experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Kind of expensive and you have to work to get your crab out. The don't have the shell crackers, only a zip tool.. Reasoning: The review contains negative aspects. While not overtly harsh, it points out two drawbacks: the price (""Kind of expensive"") and a frustrating eating experience (""have to work to get your crab out"" and the inadequate tool provided). These criticisms outweigh any potential positive aspects that might not be mentioned.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I am not a huge fan, but I have always liked the Steam pots. I went on Sunday after about a 6-8 month hiatus and the quality has really declined. Dinner came with potatoes that were frozen in the middle, and corn on the cob that was 1) not hot and 2) probably old enough to vote. Service was OK. They gave us an $11 credit to address the two bad steam pots and replaced the potatoes and corn. Unfortunately, the replacement items were not seasoned, clearly not fresh, and the corn had some black kernels on it. The crab. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative despite the restaurant attempting to rectify the issues. While the reviewer acknowledges a past fondness for the Steam pots and mentions a credit and replacement attempts, the core experience described is highly critical. The detailed complaints about food quality (frozen potatoes, old corn, lack of seasoning, black kernels, subpar crab) significantly outweigh any positive aspects. The concluding statement, ""I don't plan to go back,"" solidifies the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Never had a funner barber experience\nBlade Masters provided an original old school barber experience. Really- jokes, laughs, great conversation, and quality hair cutting filled the spacious shop. I felt like I stepped back in time when I saw the card table with dominoes at the comfy waiting area. Folks were there to simply visit, which I loved-lets you know that this business treats every customer like a member of the \""circle\""\n\nPayed a visit to Vegas and needed to cut my locks off, found Blade Masters on a google search and dropped in. Was attended to instantly, enjoyed the music and. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses enthusiastic language (""funner,"" ""loved,"" ""honestly didn't want to leave,"" ""would be back anytime"") and highlights numerous positive aspects of the experience: the atmosphere, the quality of the haircut, the conversation, the feeling of stepping back in time, and the feeling of being welcomed. Even the mention of the shaving blade is framed positively (""Freaked out a little...but decided I would be back""). The overall tone is highly complimentary and expresses a strong desire to return.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Hopefully this place is better a night . . . but we were here during the late morning . . . and did we get looked at very strangely by the regulars all sitting at the bar . . . it was full by the way . . . and it was kinda creepy. Thought if we found two seats at the bar . . . we would get people telling us to get out of Betsy's and Carl's seats or something.\n\nThe set-up looked pretty good for a local band to play and would probably be good for that .. Reasoning: The review contains several negative indicators. The reviewer describes feeling ""creeped out"" by the atmosphere and mentions a potentially hostile interaction with regulars. The statement ""I probably won't be back"" is a clear expression of dissatisfaction. While there's a brief positive mention about the venue's suitability for live music, it's overshadowed by the negative experiences described.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: The only reason I called Molly Maids was because we got a coupon in the mail for them and my mother was coming to visit. The first issue I had was that the number on the coupon didn't even work so I had to google them to get a working number. I made an appointment for Saturday morning on a Tuesday. Saturday rolls around, no call, no maids. I call and get ahold of a \""Kate\"". She proceeds to tell me that my appointment was lost or never properly recorded in their system. When I asked her how they were. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer details multiple significant failures: a non-functional coupon number, a missed appointment, a lost record of the appointment, unprofessional and rude behavior from the employee (who also happens to be the owner), and a dismissive attitude toward resolving the issues. The use of highly negative language (""G-H-E-T-T-O,"" ""terribly run,"" ""waste your time"") and the claim that the company is failing nationally further solidify the negative sentiment. There are no positive aspects mentioned.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Applebee's is just one of those boring chain restaurants. I do really love some chains, but alas, Applebee's is not one of them. Everything is just ok. Nothing ever blows my socks off or makes me crave to come here, but it isn't bad either, just blah.\n\nI found myself here yesterday because I was outvoted by the group I was with. Oh well, it happens. We went for lunch and it was an ok experience. I had the Bourbon Black and Bleu Burger. It was surprising yummy. It had a lot of kick and I had a small party in. Reasoning: While the reviewer initially expresses boredom and disappointment with Applebee's as a chain, the review progressively shifts to a more positive tone. They explicitly state the burger was ""surprising yummy"" and had a delightful flavor, the grilled cheese was surprisingly palatable even for their picky child, and the service was ""really good."" The closing acknowledges a change in opinion and praises Applebee's for doing a ""good job today."" Although the overarching feeling is still one of blandness compared to other chains, the specific experiences described are positive. This mix of initial negativity with ultimately favorable experiences leans towards a positive. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Spinach artichoke dip is the bomb, used to be bigger but hey whatever. Drinks are strong, always a good thing. The waiter, Matt, is the bomb. He helped us make decisions and have good time before going out for the night. \n\nMy friend likes the menu since it has weight watchers options, I like it for the two for $20.. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""the bomb"" (used multiple times to describe both the dip and the waiter), ""always a good thing"" (referring to strong drinks), and descriptions of helpful service (""helped us make decisions and have a good time"") clearly indicate a positive experience. Even the minor criticism about the dip's size is softened with ""hey whatever,"" showing it's not a significant detractor. The mention of weight watchers options and the $20 deal also points to positive aspects for different patrons.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: TLDR: roller skating carhops; drive-thru open late; iffy service; happy hour available\n\nSonic Drive-Ins pride themselves on providing an enriching experience with every visit. I think they miss the bar at this location. \n\nThe food and drinks are standard and came out as expected. I always try to make an effort to attend during happy hour and get a Route 44 strawberry limeade or lemon berry slush paired with a corn dog as a midday pick-me-up. \n\nThe service was...interesting. I was greeted by an individual with cornrows who appeared to be bothered by the day. Maybe it's the heat, or the. Reasoning: The review presents a mixed bag. While the reviewer appreciates aspects like the late-night drive-thru, happy hour offerings, and the general Sonic experience, there are significant negative points raised. The service is explicitly described as ""iffy"" and the interaction with the employee is negative (""dirty look""). The comment about almost hitting a carhop indicates a safety concern and a lack of professionalism. The 3/3.5 star rating and the ""okay experience"" phrasing ultimately suggest a lukewarm impression, outweighing the positive elements.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: I really like this beauty supply store, it's just so far from where I live. So when I do get to that side of town, I usually stop in because I know they have something I need or haven't seen, or need to get.. Reasoning: The reviewer expresses a clear positive sentiment (""I really like this beauty supply store""). While they mention the inconvenience of the location (""so far from where I live""), this is presented as a drawback that doesn't negate their positive feelings about the store itself. The phrase ""usually stop in"" and the appreciation for unique products further reinforces a positive experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I used to love this place three years ago. Now, everything has gone downhill. The service is lacking. Our server didn't offer drinks until we were ready to order our food, and twice we were confused with two different tables, even bringing us another table's check! My boyfriend was starving so he ordered what he THOUGHT was a steak, only to be presented with four chunks of beef on two sticks, and some grilled vegetables. The chicken fettucini had maybe three small pieces of chicken in it, which was disappointing. After we were done eating, the server tells us, \""We. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer explicitly states the place has ""gone downhill"" and details a series of issues including poor service (delayed drink offerings, table mix-ups), deceptive menu descriptions (the ""steak"" incident), skimpy portion sizes, a dismissive and unprofessional explanation from the server, and further unprofessional behavior from another server. The concluding statement, ""We're never going back there again,"" confirms the extremely negative experience. The overall tone is critical and disappointed.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: My husband and I went to this particular location after church. We normally go to the W. Sahara location but we were on this side of town. We were immediately seated and was told that our waitress named Tiffany will be right over. Ten minutes later a lady came over and said that Tiffany was a little busy but can she start us out with drinks? I couldn't quite understand why she would be, do the fact that there was less than ten people in the building but OK.. Since we've been here a few times ,we already were familiar. Reasoning: The review contains a mix of experiences, but leans negative overall. While the initial seating was prompt, the lack of the promised waitress (Tiffany) and the excessively long wait times for both the salad and the main course are significant negative points. The reviewer explicitly states the food wasn’t as good as at a different location, and they skipped dessert due to the poor service. The concern for Tiffany’s well-being at the end is a touch of empathy, but doesn’t negate the overall negative experience related to the service.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Dingy and smokey, but a decent neighborhood watering hole. Typical Vegas style bar that's been around for decades.\n\nGood pool tables and they host a few leagues there. Bartenders and bar staff are all cool and pour with a heavy hand. My friends's Makers and coke was 98% Makers with a splash of Coke for color!\n\nA lot of regulars and friendly boisterous bunch at that. I've never eaten here but at least they have a separate dining area for the non smokers, like me, because this place is nicotine heaven.. Reasoning: The review contains both negative and positive elements. The opening mentions ""dingy and smokey"" which are clear negatives. However, it follows this with ""decent neighborhood watering hole"" and highlights positives like good pool tables, friendly staff, generous pours, and a separate dining area for non-smokers. The overall tone leans towards acceptance and enjoyment of the bar's character and offerings, despite the smoke. The reviewer seems to have had a generally positive experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Just your average Wal-Mart what else can I say? Service prices all the same. Nothing different here than any other Wal-Mart.. Reasoning: The review expresses a lack of any distinguishing characteristics or positive experiences. Phrases like ""average,"" ""nothing different,"" and a simple acknowledgement of standard prices and service indicate a complete absence of enthusiasm or dissatisfaction – just a statement of the expected. This aligns with a neutral sentiment.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: HORRIBLE! We waited 2 hours! I made an appointment and they didn't take us in right away, the nails the lady did weren't pretty, she still wanted to charge so much money We will never return! Horrible service, not worth the money you pay. please stay away I wish I could give this NO stars -.-. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly negative language. Words like ""HORRIBLE,"" ""didn't take us in right away,"" ""weren't pretty,"" ""still wanted to charge so much money,"" ""never return,"" and ""stay away"" clearly express extreme dissatisfaction. The reviewer’s desire to give ""NO stars"" further solidifies the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Worst Eyebrow Waxing!\nI need my eyebrows done BAD! I onky went in because my husband was at a store next door. \nThe lady told me to go to the back and that shed be there in a sec.. as soon as she came in she just started putting wax on my eyebrows! Didnt say A WORD! So I stopped her and explained how I wanted them. She got all pissy and started loudly chompin on her gum then she started plucking my eyebrows so rough and fast and clipped some skin! NEVER COMING BACK! Picture shown is AFTER my eyebrows. Reasoning: The review uses extremely negative language (""Worst,"" ""pissy,"" ""rough,"" ""fast,"" ""clipped some skin,"" ""NEVER COMING BACK""). The customer details a series of unprofessional and painful experiences, culminating in them having to fix the eyebrows themselves. The inclusion of a photo highlighting the poor result further underscores the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Once again, Panda has given me poor, slow service and a streaming serving of meh. Why do I keep torturing myself? \n\nThree ppl in line, including me. Mr. Whispersalot keeps asking me questions that I can't hear over the music, workers, banging pots, and someone's screaming child. His co worker leans in and yells at me what he was asking, with lots of gesticulation, like I'm an imbecile. It's not that I couldn't understand him - I just couldn't HEAR him. Finally, I get across that I want the broccoli beef to go. He spoons it into the bowl and. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer uses highly critical language throughout, detailing numerous issues with the service including slow speed, inaudible communication, rude employee behavior (yelling, gesticulating, ignoring the customer), and general disorganization. The repetition of phrases emphasizing frustration (""Arrrgh!"", ""Why do I keep torturing myself?"") and the concluding statement that the aggravation outweighs the food's quality firmly establishes a negative experience. The descriptive language used paints a picture of a deeply unpleasant interaction.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Food Availability: For some reason we arrive between 5pm-7pm, their popular Honey Walnut or regular fried rice always seems to be out. I guess we just arrive after busy hours or early diners? I'm not sure but some food choices are less then a scoop empty (majority are full depending on demand) and some ppl must wait until a fresh batch is made depending upon demand. \n\nBeen here a couple times since its on the way home from work. I go here with a coworker during dinner time between 5pm - 7pm depending what time we arrive. \nPretty much slow. Reasoning: While the review expresses frustration regarding food availability during a specific timeframe (5pm-7pm), the overall tone is not overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer acknowledges the convenience of the location, praises the employee Luis (""very courteous and responsive""), and describes the atmosphere as ""quiet and settling."" The explicit mention of awarding ""2 stars for Luis"" and highlighting his customer service indicates a positive aspect of the experience. The frustration regarding food availability is presented as an observation rather than a scathing critique. The closing statement ""keeps this place from having a lackluster dining experience"" also suggests a generally positive impression.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I ordered from the website for this location. Luckily enough it also gives you a tracker to tell you where your pizza is in the process. Unfortunately for them it showed me that the pizza was out of the oven and sitting in the store for about 30 minutes before it even left with the delivery driver. I don't mind waiting for pizza, but I do not expect it to be 40 minutes old by the time it gets to me. On top of that I complained and was told that they would give 2 LG free on my next. Reasoning: The review expresses significant frustration and disappointment. While the user initially acknowledges a positive feature (the order tracker), the core of the review details a negative experience – a pizza sitting out for 30 minutes before delivery and a broken promise regarding compensation. The user explicitly states they are disappointed and notes the existence of better pizza options elsewhere. This strongly indicates a negative overall sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I've ordered delivery twice for papa John's. both times my pizza was delivered at room temperature. The second pizza was even free courtesy of the manager because of it. and both times I was told that it would take 45-60mns and took close to 2hrs. I was accommodated for my dissatisfaction, so the reason for me writing this is not to come down on the staff, but there needs to be a change. Maybe they need to hire more people or whatever unless they want to keep giving away free pizzas.. Reasoning: While the reviewer acknowledges being compensated for the issues (""The second pizza was even free...I was accommodated for my dissatisfaction""), the core of the review details significant negative experiences: cold pizza delivered late on two separate occasions. The overall tone expresses frustration and a desire for systemic change, indicating a negative perception of the service despite the attempt at resolution. The repeated mentions of problems outweigh the positive acknowledgement of the manager's actions.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: They now charge items by the pound... practically a rummage sale.\n\nyes... fill your cart up with whatever.. you want & they put it on the scale for .99cents a pound...items such as books furniture & electronics are at a flat rate...\nmy mom ALWAYS goes here & comes back with at least 5 full bags...\nThey put everything in bins you have to rummage thru everything..\nBooks are .25cents which is why I will go back.. Reasoning: This review presents a mixed bag of feelings. While the reviewer expresses annoyance at the ""rummage sale"" style pricing and the need to ""rummage thru everything,"" they also highlight a significant positive – the incredibly low price of books (.25 cents) and their mother's consistent success in acquiring a lot of items (""at least 5 full bags""). The reviewer explicitly states they *will* go back, indicating a degree of satisfaction despite the drawbacks. Overall, the positive aspects (price) outweigh the negative (shopping experience).. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: We went to live to eat taco and I got the cashier service bues these ali does not want to take water from natural and has a bad attitude bad. Reasoning: The review contains several strong negative descriptors like ""bad attitude"" and ""does not want."" While the user mentions going to ""live to eat taco"" (likely intending a positive association with the food), the overwhelmingly negative experience with the cashier overshadows any potential positive aspects. The fragmented and misspelled nature of the writing further suggests frustration and a negative overall impression.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Waited almost 3 hours for them to complete my oil change because of a plug I needed. The auto parts store kept bringing over the wrong part. They even had to send Midas people there. Customer service and communication was horrible. They kept making excuses for themselves and weren't even accommodating. They kept saying that they are trying to help by offering me the plug versus the oil pan that would be more money. I wish they would have been upfront with me and told me how long the job would take. I will NEVER come back to Midas again.. Reasoning: The review expresses significant frustration and dissatisfaction. The language used is highly negative, including phrases like ""waited almost 3 hours,"" ""horrible customer service,"" ""making excuses,"" ""not even accommodating,"" and a definitive statement of never returning. The reviewer highlights multiple failures in service and communication. There are no positive aspects mentioned.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: They charged $110 to tell me that my gas cap wasn't screwed on tightly. After my furious husband told them that we would obviously not be back, the manager told us that was fine, and proceeded to flip my husband off as we drove out. Nice customer service. \n\nJust for the record, we went there about a year prior to this service call for new brakes and spent about $400. The team back then was completely different and had great customer service which is why we went back in the first place. \n\nDon't go there.. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The language used is highly critical, detailing a frustrating experience involving an inflated charge, dismissive behavior from the manager (including a rude gesture), and a clear indication that the reviewer will not return. While the reviewer mentions a positive past experience, it only serves to highlight the stark contrast and reinforces the current negative sentiment. Phrases like ""furious,"" ""obviously not be back,"" and ""Don't go there"" are strong indicators of a negative experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Yeah, one star for stealing my honey's credit card. Thank goodness American Express is more loyal to its customers than you people are. Using his credit card up & down Nellis blvd is retarded. \nEat a dick & gain some integrity.. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The language is aggressive, accusatory (""stealing my honey's credit card,"" ""Using his credit card...is retarded""), and contains profanity and insults (""Eat a dick""). The reviewer expresses extreme dissatisfaction and a clear lack of trust. There is absolutely no positive sentiment expressed.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Got home after picking up my order and realized they forgot my breadsticks. I even ordered extra. I called to get a refund on the extra ones and was told I would need to speak to a manager, 10 minutes holding and no one. I hung up. Poor customer service. Food was good though.. Reasoning: While the reviewer mentions the food was ""good,"" the overwhelming tone is negative due to the significant issues with order fulfillment and customer service. The forgotten breadsticks (especially ordered extra), the frustrating experience trying to get a refund, the excessive hold time, and the ultimate lack of resolution all point to a very poor experience. The positive comment about the food is overshadowed by these negative interactions.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: i thought pharmacists were supposed to help people. if i could give less then 1 star i would. the woman here treats every patient like a drug addict. my sister had just got out of the hospital after having her gall bladder removed and this woman wouldnt fill her prescription. i would go anywhere but here. and i wish i could do more than just leave this review.. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer expresses extreme dissatisfaction, using phrases like ""if I could give less than 1 star,"" ""treats every patient like a drug addict,"" and ""would go anywhere but here."" The specific complaint about a prescription being denied and the overall tone of frustration and anger clearly indicate a very negative experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Never actually ate in there but we ordered some dishes once and they were disappointing. We ordered some shrimp chow mein and some beef dish and both dishes were filled with filler. The shrimp dish had those little shrimp that you usually find in fried rice and the rest of the dish was all basically frozen vegetables. Everything seemed like it came out of the cheapest bulk bag of product they could find at Costco. I don't know about the buffet but nothing I ate made me want to go back. The place has been open for at least 7-8. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer acknowledges the restaurant has been open for a long time and seems popular for families, this is framed as a consequence of low prices rather than quality. The core of the review focuses on the poor quality of the food they ordered – describing it as filled with filler, frozen vegetables, and appearing to be sourced from the cheapest possible ingredients. Direct comparisons to better alternatives (""Boulder and Sam's Town buffets"") further emphasize the negative experience. The repeated criticisms outweigh any mitigating factors.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: We came here after a stress-filled morning and were pleasantly surprised. This Denny's is nothing like the one we'd been to previously. The cook actually did a great job, the service was spot-on and the waitress was awesome.. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""pleasantly surprised,"" ""great job,"" ""spot-on,"" and ""awesome"" clearly indicate a positive experience. The comparison to a previous, presumably negative, experience further emphasizes the positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Doesn't even deserve 1 star. Dirty store, the most Ghetto, worst customer service including management, aisles always blocked at night so customers can't walk through loud vulgar employees yelling through the store. More people begging in parking lot than customers. Products never labeled correctly. Never enough cashiers or employees at customer service desk.. Reasoning: This review uses extremely negative language and focuses entirely on problems with the store's cleanliness, staff behavior, product labeling, and overall environment. Phrases like ""doesn't even deserve 1 star,"" ""Dirty store,"" ""worst customer service,"" ""loud vulgar employees,"" and ""begging in parking lot"" paint a picture of a severely unpleasant experience. There are no positive aspects mentioned whatsoever.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Ok food. Ok service. Left smelling horrible of cigarette smoke.. Reasoning: While the review starts with ""Ok food"" and ""Ok service,"" which aren't overtly negative, the concluding statement about smelling horribly of cigarette smoke introduces a significant and unpleasant experience. This negative aspect outweighs the mild positivity of the initial comments. The lingering negative impact of the smell suggests a dissatisfying overall experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I would give the food 4 stars... Their staff would get 0 stars... So, I feel 2 stars is fair. I love their food and was exited to learn there was one right down the street from Nellis AFB! But, I will not be going back to this location! My order was rang out wrong. I was given an attitude about them forgetting my drink. Then, my sandwich was wrong and I didn't ask them to remark it. I simple asked for the pickles they forgot. I was screamed at because my pickles would come out of the cashiers pay?!. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer expresses affection for the food (""I love their food""), this is completely overshadowed by a litany of extremely negative experiences with the staff. The reviewer details multiple instances of rudeness, arguing, and unprofessional behavior culminating in verbal abuse. The explicit statement that they ""will not be going back"" and the threat to publicly share the negative experience further solidify the negative sentiment. The few positive comments are dwarfed by the extensive negative details.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: The staff was nice but didn't listen when our order was taken and some of the order was messed up. Some of the customers were very loud and ghetto. The tables could be cleaned better! I didn't want to go into the bathroom.. Reasoning: This review contains a mix of positive and negative elements, but the negative aspects significantly outweigh the positive. While the staff being ""nice"" is a positive, it's immediately countered by the order being incorrect due to lack of attention. The comments about loud, disruptive customers and uncleanliness (""tables could be cleaned better,"" and avoidance of the bathroom) contribute heavily to a negative experience. The overall tone suggests dissatisfaction and discomfort.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I've been to this restaurant a few times now the first time was a good experience fast sitting no wait for drinks and not a long wait for food. The second time not so good I went on 4th. of July and it wasn't busy at all maybe 5 or 6 tables with people and 4 waitresses. So services should of been fast so you would think. We order our sons food first being 4 he has a small attention span when it comes to restaurants and places a like. After we order him eggs and toast we were told. Reasoning: The review presents a mixed bag of experiences. The initial visit was positive, but the subsequent visit on the 4th of July was significantly negative due to extremely slow service and a disinterested waitress. While the reviewer acknowledges the food is ""good,"" the strong recommendation to ""skip this and head somewhere else"" due to the service issues heavily outweighs the positive aspect. The overall tone leans toward disappointment and a negative assessment of the restaurant.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Great breakfast joint that reminds me of waffle-house. Do not order anything that could be stored in the fridge as it tastes like it have ( huevos ranchos ). Massive omlettes that are worth the price.. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""Great breakfast joint,"" ""worth the price,"" and the comparison to Waffle House (generally perceived positively) indicate enjoyment. While there’s a single criticism about a refrigerated item, it's presented as a specific issue rather than a reflection of the overall experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Service is great. Price is nice and food is good. The real gem here are the appetizers. The crispest fried chicken wings, \nshrimp and vegetables you will find anywhere at any cost. Have not ate buffet...not buffet guy.. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""Service is great,"" ""Price is nice,"" ""food is good,"" and ""real gem"" all indicate a favorable experience. The enthusiastic praise for the appetizers (""crispest... anywhere at any cost"") is a strong indicator of a positive sentiment. The final comment about not being a ""buffet guy"" is a personal preference and doesn't detract from the overall positive tone.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I must say since Sears took over they did a good job with Kmart. The prices aren't bad. From TV's to housewares. They seem to carry higher end products than Walmart. The furniture is of higher quality too. Picked up a nice real wood kitchen table. Its like a mini Sears. It was 8pm and only 3 cashiers were working. They still have layaway and implemented a rewards card program. If more people shop here it will knock Walmart off its high horse. I will be back.. Reasoning: The review overwhelmingly expresses positive sentiment. The author explicitly states Sears did a ""good job"" with Kmart, praises the prices, quality of products (higher end than Walmart, real wood table), and mentions positive changes like layaway and a rewards program. The closing statement (""I will be back"") is a clear indicator of satisfaction. While the mention of only 3 cashiers at 8pm represents a minor inconvenience, it’s presented within a largely positive overall experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Friendly and excellent service, large polish selection! \n\nI called and made an appointment for the same day. I got their basic pedicure service, which was only $20 but they have $30 and $40 packages as well. \n\nWhat made a good impression on me is that they don't have the overpowering chemical smell as most nail places. Maybe it's because they are a full-service salon (mani/pedi, massage, hair salon, make-up, eyelash extensions). Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""friendly and excellent service,"" ""good impression,"" and the mention of a reasonable price point all contribute to a positive tone. The reviewer also highlights a desirable feature (lack of strong chemical smell) and notes the breadth of services offered, further reinforcing the positive experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I feel like Rachel Ray's evil twin when I talk about this place. Yuck-O!\n\nThis is located by a bunch of office buildings in the industrial part of the city, so I know who they're catering to. It's quick, it's easy, and I have a feeling that a lot of burly guys workin' fork lifts all day don't have the most delicate of palates.\n\nHowever, I worked by here for a while and while I did sometimes I got stuck at my desk through lunch hour. Munch a Sub (we ended up calling it Punch a Pud) was my only hope. \n\nThe. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer acknowledges the restaurant caters to a specific demographic and was sometimes a lifeline during a lunch crunch, the core experience is consistently described with intensely negative language. Phrases like ""Rachel Ray's evil twin,"" ""Yuck-O!,"" ""soggy,"" ""tasted like processed food stuffs,"" ""limp,"" ""wrong,"" and the concluding recommendation to only use it in ""dire episodes of near starvation"" clearly indicate a very poor opinion. The tone is sarcastic and mocking, further solidifying the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: One of the worse carne asada burritos I ever had. I will never go back. And the salsa? You've got to be kidding me. Did you get it from a can?. Reasoning: The review uses strongly negative language (""One of the worse,"" ""never go back,"" ""you've got to be kidding me""). It directly criticizes both the main dish (carne asada burrito) and a side (salsa) with disparaging remarks, expressing extreme dissatisfaction. This unequivocally points to a negative experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Probably one of the worst resorts I have been to. The place looks and feels like a 5 star resort, but once you settle you'll notice that your eyes will deceive you. \n\nWe checked in with some amazing staff (which is why I didn't give this place a 1 star) and we walked out the door and were caught up by the timeshare ladies. We ended up signing up and claimed our $100 gift card. We then went to the room. Here's a quick summary of the resort.\n\nPRO's:\n\n -Decent looking rooms\n-Decent Customer Service\n\n-CON's: \n\n-NO Wifi? Are you kidding me? I. Reasoning: While the reviewer acknowledges some positive aspects (amazing staff, decent looking rooms, decent customer service), the overwhelming tone is highly critical and negative. The extensive list of ""CON's"" – including lack of Wi-Fi, thin walls, unpleasant smells, malfunctioning remotes, and drainage problems – significantly outweighs any positives. The concluding recommendation to choose elsewhere solidifies the negative sentiment. The initial positive comment about the staff is somewhat mitigated by the immediate follow-up about being ambushed by timeshare salespeople.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: One of the top tier Hampton's we have stayed at, and we have been to a lot of them across the USA. Quiet, comfortable, and great breakfast with ample eating area. Within easy walk of The Strip. The only Hampton with a full bar and slots for those who want to leave a little money in Vegas. Highly recommend.. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""top tier,"" ""quiet,"" ""comfortable,"" ""great breakfast,"" ""highly recommend,"" and the enthusiastic description of the unique bar/slots all indicate a very favorable experience. There are no negative comments or qualifiers to detract from the positive tone.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: What is there really to say about Roberto's that's new? Most people know about the chain by now. But I will note two things:\n\n1) Many of the stores have slight variations on their specials menu so it's always worth checking out.\n\n2) Just from personal experience, while their menu is standardized, I tend to stick to older locations. Maybe it's all in my head, but the food just seems cheesier and more delicious at the older locations in town versus the super-sleep looking newer ones. Then again, maybe I am a sucker for spots that let their food do the talking. Reasoning: The review is quite nuanced. While it acknowledges the chain nature of Roberto's and doesn't express overwhelming enthusiasm, it highlights positive aspects like the varying specials (""worth checking out"") and a personal preference for older locations which are perceived as having better food (""cheesier and more delicious""). The final comment about preferring places that let the food speak for itself suggests a value for authenticity and quality, which is positive. The tone isn't overly effusive, but it's ultimately favorable.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Yelp has this place listed twice. The one on Industrial Rd is the same as this place. A bit odd.\n\nOverall, this is nicer than your typical Hampton Inn. It's all in a South Pacific theme and the lobby area has a staffed bar, which I've never seen in a Hampton property. Staff was quite genuinely friendly. The place seems clean and rooms are outfitted very nicely. \n\nI have one major gripe, though, and I would never stay here on business again because of it. There's no WiFi in the guest rooms. They have wired connections available, but I hate being. Reasoning: The review presents a mixed bag of opinions. While the reviewer praises the unique theme, friendly staff, cleanliness, nice rooms, value, and location, the lack of guest room WiFi is a significant and stated dealbreaker (""major gripe"" and prevents business travel). The sluggish lobby WiFi doesn’t compensate. The positive elements are somewhat overshadowed by this crucial negative.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: i used this business 2 years ago and signed up for a year of service for $25.00\nper month. i had my thermostat replaced and the service person said i needed\n2 compactors for my furnace, costing around $250. he tried to \""sell\"" me a\nnew heater/a/c unit, which i declined.\n\nanother new service person came to check out my \""free\"" a/c unit last spring,\nbut it cost $159.00. he said he would put himself down, on paper, to schedule\nmy next service. i did NOT like that! \n\nsince he was buying a new home, he also tried to \""sell\"" me a new heater/a/c unit;\nand even. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer details a series of problematic interactions, including pushy sales tactics (repeated attempts to sell new units), unexpected and costly service charges ($159 for a ""free"" AC check), unprofessional behavior (writing down the schedule without consent, asking intrusive questions about the house), and general discomfort with the sales approach. The concluding statement, ""would not recommend this kind of service to anyone,"" solidifies the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Again, a place that doesnt look like much from the outside but I assure you, this place is the bees knees!! Their breakfast burritos are the best I have ever had! I am a huge fan and go here a couple times a month. Great rolled tacos and enchiladas as well. Their green salsa is to die for. Go here and get a breakfast burrito, you wont be disappointed!!. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""the bees knees,"" ""best I have ever had,"" ""huge fan,"" ""great,"" and ""to die for"" clearly indicate a very favorable opinion. The reviewer's repeated visits (a couple times a month) further reinforces their enthusiasm. There are no negative comments or criticisms present.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: mm.. it's okay here!? \njust moving from one state to another and getting situated at home calls for a lot of take-out, so i figured... now's the time to really see what's up with these places that are generally new to the area too... (sort of.)\n\nso, i say....\ntheir are better places for chinese take-out.. Reasoning: The review expresses a lukewarm and ultimately negative assessment. While the reviewer acknowledges the place is ""okay,"" the concluding sentence, ""there are better places for Chinese take-out,"" is a clear indication of dissatisfaction and a negative comparison. The surrounding text explaining the context doesn't change the core negative takeaway.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Oh Good God. NO!\n\nI stopped by here the other day for lunch because I had to do my weekly run for lunch for our pricing meeting. I wasn't in the mood for what I was getting for everyone else so I thought Chinese, as long as they have a lunch special - why not?\n\nSo tried I did. And never again.\n\nYou walk in and they are helpful and friendly. The place is big and clean.\n\nOf course it's your typical standard \""Chinese fare\"". Their menu was big and many, many choices. \n\nI had to spend at least ten dollars so I could. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer acknowledges the friendly staff, cleanliness, and the potstickers being acceptable, the core of their experience—the main dish—was described with extremely unfavorable language (""NASTY,"" ""rubber chicken,"" ""not fresh,"" ""upset stomach""). The strong negative descriptors and the overall tone of disappointment outweigh the few positive mentions. The analogy to ""jail"" at the end reinforces the reviewer's intense dissatisfaction.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: These guys are crooks. They could not have been less organized when bringing our goods into the convention hall. It was as if they let 50 guys out of prison and give them forklifts. No joke. The guys who were supposed to unload our truck got into a violent argument over their favorite classic rock bands, so we ended up unloading the truck. \n\nWeeks later I find out that it cost me $1.00 per pound to move my exhibit the 200 ft from the loading dock to my space. I can ship goods from Boston to California for $0.30 per. Reasoning: The review uses extremely negative language throughout. Words like ""crooks,"" ""violent argument,"" ""terrible service,"" ""garbage,"" and phrases like ""total joke"" and ""can't last"" paint a picture of a deeply unsatisfactory and exploitative experience. The writer also details significant financial loss and expresses a strong likelihood of never returning, implying a severe negative impact. The tone is accusatory and filled with anger and frustration.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Agree 100% with every review here. This is exactly why so many Americans despise union labor! \n\nEXTORTION is defined as \""the crime of obtaining money or some other thing of value by the abuse of one's office or authority\"". This couldn't be a more fitting term for this company. You are absolutely forced to use their useless services that barely anyone needs, and be charged completely egregious amounts! \n\nMy colleagues and I attended an event where packing up our materials took all of about 6 minutes, yet they still charged us for their \""union labor\"" of about $400. Ok so. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer uses extremely strong, accusatory language (""extortion,"" ""greedy,"" ""corrupt,"" ""useless,"" ""archaic,"" ""lazieness""). They directly criticize the company’s pricing and labor practices, alleging unfair and exploitative behavior. The tone is highly critical and filled with resentment, leaving no room for a positive interpretation. The extended metaphor comparing the company's practices to a failing system further emphasizes the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: If you work in the restaurant or baking business, chances are you have heard of or have purchased items from Chef Rubber. They carry a wide selection of items (i.e., baking equipments, cooking tools, molecular gastronomy ingredients, rare or hard to find cookbooks).\n\nMost of the people do business with Chef Rubber through online purchases, but they do have a physical location in Las Vegas (even if it is located in a non-descript commercial building with a really small Chef Rubber logo. Taking a cab here is possible, but not recommended, as trying to get a cab on the way back. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive despite mentioning the high prices and slightly inconvenient location. The reviewer highlights the impressive selection (""a lot of stuff,"" ""wide selection""), the opportunity to learn from talented chefs, and the enjoyment derived from browsing the store. While the prices are noted as ""pricey"" and the location has some drawbacks, these are presented as trade-offs for the unique offering. The high ratings given for selection (4.5/5) strongly indicate a positive experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Awesome place, they have everything, i couldn't believe my eyes. The staff there is amazing!!!. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language (""Awesome,"" ""amazing,"" ""couldn't believe my eyes""). It expresses a strong sense of satisfaction and enthusiasm. There are no negative words or criticisms present.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: The worst of the worst, did not keep their booking prepaid for a stretch limo.\n\nTerrible customer service by management as they never call you back when a problem arises.\n\nRuined our wedding.. Reasoning: This review uses extremely negative language (""worst of the worst,"" ""terrible,"" ""ruined""). It describes a significant failure of service (losing a prepaid booking), poor communication (""never call you back""), and a devastating impact (""ruined our wedding""). The overall tone expresses extreme dissatisfaction and disappointment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: It's 7:30 am. Time for breakfast. Let's see... Hmmm... no eggs of any kind. Do I want a plate of sausage gravy or some turkey sausage? Maybe a banana that was ripe about 2 weeks ago. Maybe I can have both the gravy AND the turkey sausage...\n\nAfter 10 minutes of this and watching Magdelina make sure that there were PLENTY of froot loops to go along with the over ripe bananas, the sausage gravy, and the turkey sausage,, I grabbed a cup of coffee and went on my way... Hungry.\n\nThere are literally HUNDREDS of hotels in Las Vegas. Stay elsewhere.. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment with the limited breakfast options (""no eggs of any kind,"" ""over ripe bananas""), highlights a seemingly bizarre focus on providing ample Froot Loops while other items are lacking, and conveys a feeling of dissatisfaction (""Hungry.""). The concluding statement, ""Stay elsewhere,"" is a direct and forceful recommendation against the establishment, solidifying the negative sentiment. The sarcastic tone throughout also contributes to the negative assessment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Garbage company. Took a town car from the airport to our hotel, set up the return trip with the driver. His name was Ashley Silver, and he never reserved the return trip. Called the company to confirm last night and they knew nothing about us. So we set up a car for this morning at 6am, and when it was almost too late to get another service we get an email saying there was no car available. \n\nDO NOT use this lousy company or you will likely end up stuck somewhere.. Reasoning: The review uses extremely negative language (""Garbage company,"" ""lousy company,"" ""DO NOT use""). It details a series of significant failures regarding a pre-booked airport transfer, leading to a stressful and potentially costly situation for the customer. The tone is accusatory and expresses strong dissatisfaction.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Was just dropped off at Bellagio. Realized left phone In car. Called the company and driver says it's not in there. Called within 5 minutes of being dropped off. Will update this post if it is found otherwise I am skeptical that it still isn't in the car\n Sentimental pics on phone too. Reasoning: The review expresses frustration and suspicion regarding a lost phone. While it starts with a seemingly neutral observation (""Was just dropped off at Bellagio""), the subsequent events – losing a phone, the driver's denial, and the reviewer's skepticism – clearly indicate a negative experience. The mention of ""sentimental pics"" further emphasizes the distress caused by the situation.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Jonathon Bridges, you are an amazing taxi driver. Thank you so much for your service on 11/22/14. He was attentive, giving us useful information around the strip. He even asked us before we hopped out of the taxi if there was anything else he could help us with. He was sooo nice! I can't thank him enough! If you are calling for a cab for this company, ask for Jonathon Bridges. Trust me.. we all know how typical cab drivers are in Vegas especially.. he is different! TRUST ME!. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""amazing taxi driver,"" ""sooo nice,"" ""can't thank him enough,"" and the emphatic ""TRUST ME!"" clearly indicate a highly positive experience. The reviewer also directly contrasts Jonathon with the typical negative stereotypes of Vegas cab drivers, further highlighting the exceptional nature of his service.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Negative star! This place is the last place you want to go. I went there to get my lab results, they had me wait for 2 hrs just to tell me my labs aren't ready and i had to come back!. Reasoning: The review uses extremely negative language (""Negative star!"", ""last place you want to go""). The described experience – a two-hour wait for a negative outcome – is clearly frustrating and indicates a very poor service. The overall tone is highly critical and expresses strong dissatisfaction.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: OUTSTANDING COMMUNICATION, SERVICE AND QUALITY REPAIR!\nI couldn't be happier!\nFREE loan car! No, or partial deductible!\nOnly 8 business days to make my 2006 Solara look like new! I HIGHLY recommend them!\nTell 'em I sent you!!!\n- Gary. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""OUTSTANDING,"" ""couldn't be happier,"" ""HIGHLY recommend,"" and the enthusiastic tone throughout clearly indicate a very positive experience. The additional perks mentioned (free loan car, no/partial deductible, quick turnaround) further reinforce this positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: The worst ran business in Las Vegas. I needed a scratch on a bumper to be buffed and painted. The man said 1 day....well four days later they are still not done. Here's the best part. They claim to have a \""loaner\"" car. The car wouldn't even kick into gear and is a danger to drive, not only to the driver but the general public. I arrive on the 4th day to pick up the car they said it's still not done and to come back in 30-45 minutes. No call ahead to let me know that it would be. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The language used is extremely critical, containing phrases like ""worst run business,"" ""danger to drive,"" ""don't waste your time,"" and a general tone of frustration and dissatisfaction. The reviewer details multiple significant issues, including excessive delays, a dangerous ""loaner"" car, lack of communication, and unexpected payment restrictions. There are no positive aspects mentioned.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Near Chef Rubber they have the large-scale equipment and smaller wares you would need in order to open a food business. They have a lot of dishes, tools, pans for a cheaper price if its what you need.. Reasoning: The review highlights affordability (""cheaper price"") and the availability of a wide range of equipment (""large-scale equipment and smaller wares""), which are both positive attributes for someone looking to start a food business. The overall tone expresses usefulness and value.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Swung by one morning on my way to work. Only had about 15 minutes to browse around. Definitely not enough time to see fully what this place had. From what I could see, they had mostly small wares, although they do have some big equipment as well. The prices were high on some things, low on others. They have rows and rows of small items, that I could not explore this trip, so next time I'll make sure I go when I'm not rushed.. Reasoning: The review expresses a generally positive impression despite a frustrating experience. The reviewer acknowledges the potential of the place (""Definitely not enough time to see fully what this place had""), finds it interesting (""mostly small wares, although they do have some big equipment as well""), and indicates a desire to return (""next time I'll make sure I go when I'm not rushed""). While mentioning high prices on some items, it's balanced by the acknowledgement that others were low. The overall tone is more appreciative than disappointed.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: HATE One of my shirts had a stain when I got it back that was NOT there when I dropped it off. Inattentive employees (I literally rang the bell 10 times with no response after waiting for a clerk for 15 minutes).\n\nDISLIKE They laundered my shirts after I told them I wanted them dry cleaned (partially my fault cause I didn't make sure the ESL clerk understood me).\n\nLIKE Open late.\n\nLOVE Nothing.. Reasoning: The review overwhelmingly expresses negative sentiment. While the reviewer acknowledges liking the late hours, the dominant language (""HATE,"" ""DISLIKE,"" ""Nothing"" for LOVE) and the specific complaints about stained clothing, inattentive staff (ringing the bell repeatedly), and incorrect service (laundering instead of dry cleaning) demonstrate a significantly negative experience. The brief acknowledgment of a partial responsibility for the dry cleaning misunderstanding doesn't outweigh the substantial negativity.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I usually like La Quinta but this one was not a great choice. I don't think there are many people here. There are only about 5 cars in the parking lot. But the room is ok. Not lovely like other La Quintas. I think La Quinta should reconsider this hotel. It doesn't represent their brand At All.\nIn specific, the TV isn't good. A light bulb was burn't out. The Coffee at breakfast was about 1/2 strength (that's just weird). and the closet hasn't been vacuumed in a long time.\nSIGH.\n\nSo much for making reservations on line.. Reasoning: This review expresses disappointment and criticism despite acknowledging the room was ""ok."" The reviewer highlights multiple negative aspects (burnt-out bulb, weak coffee, unclean closet, sparse parking, TV issues) and directly suggests La Quinta should reconsider the hotel's inclusion in their brand. The ""SIGH"" at the end reinforces a feeling of frustration. While not overwhelmingly negative, the consistent complaints and negative suggestions outweigh any minor positive acknowledgement.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Let me start by saying that I've been to this ER 10 times, and have been admitted for a 3-5 day stay 8 times over the last 3 years. \nI have a chronic kidney condition that acts up every couple months and usually leaves me laid up for a week in excruciating pain.\n\nAfter my last 2 experiences, I will never come back to this ER EVER again, if I can help it.\n\nER review: \nWhen I first came here after my surgeries, everyone was kind, attentive, and VERY good...getting IVs was fairly painless (for getting an IV).\n\nThe second to last time. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer details multiple deeply frustrating and negative experiences with the ER and hospital, including misdiagnosis, inappropriate medication prescriptions despite known allergies and medical history, dismissive and rude staff, and a general lack of care and understanding. The repeated expressions of frustration (""Idiots,"" ""AWFUL,"" ""never come back"") and the sarcastic tone leave no doubt about the reviewer's extremely negative perception of the facility. While acknowledging past positive experiences, the reviewer's overall conclusion is a staunch refusal to return.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: My elderly parents live in Las Vegas. They are 84 years old. Recently, due to a serious illness my father was admitted and treated at Spring Valley Hospital for pneumonia. From the moment he was admitted to the ER, then subsequently transferred to the hospitals Critical Care Unit on the 2nd floor he received nothing but the best treatment, care and consideration. The doctors and nurses were exceptional. We were even offered a bed to sleep in so that my sybillings and I could stay the night with him. \nHe was admitted 4 more times over the last few months.. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly positive. The author explicitly praises the ""best treatment, care and consideration"" received by their father and now their mother. They highlight the exceptional doctors and nurses, the kindness shown (offering a bed for family), and the quality of care received during multiple admissions. They actively negate any potential negatives (negligence, early discharge) and mention a positive workplace environment as indicated by staff happiness and longevity. The strong recommendation further solidifies the positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: The only good tasting food here is the pulled pork sandwich, everything else is poor. I am from the east coast where we have BBQ cook offs and such, so I know good BBQ. This place does a poor job in my opinion. Friendly waitresses/servers and good sweet tea but that's about it.. Reasoning: While the reviewer praises the pulled pork sandwich and mentions friendly service and good sweet tea, the overwhelming tone expresses disappointment. The statement ""everything else is poor"" carries significant negative weight, especially when coupled with the assertion that they are familiar with ""good BBQ"" and this place falls short. The overall impression is one of dissatisfaction despite a few positive aspects.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I took the time to drive to what I was told was a great BBQ place, after one experience here I won't be back . I had to gnaw through a rack of baby back ribs the consistency of jerky , with hardly any sauce to speak of, and when I asked for extra sauce what they game did not taste as good as the BBQ sauce I dip my nuggets in at \""insert fast food chain here\"". Even the rolls were stale,the highlight of my meal was the sweet potato which a 3 year old could master the cooking. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer uses harsh language (""gnaw through,"" ""consistency of jerky,"" ""stale"") to describe the food. They directly state they won't return and compare the BBQ sauce unfavorably to fast food. The deprecating comment about the sweet potato further emphasizes the negative experience. There are no redeeming qualities mentioned.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: My favorite place to eat in Las Vegas. Solid BBQ.\n\nTry the Hot Links.. Reasoning: The reviewer explicitly states this is their ""favorite place to eat,"" which is a very strong positive indicator. The descriptor ""Solid BBQ"" is also positive. The recommendation to ""Try the Hot Links"" further reinforces a positive experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Absolutely the worst meal ever. Catfish was old fishy and the wait staff\"" we've had a lot of complaints. It must really be bad\"" wth . .burnt ends were crap too. Not fresh at all.. Reasoning: The review contains extremely negative language. Phrases like ""worst meal ever,"" ""old fishy,"" ""crap,"" and ""not fresh at all"" clearly express strong dissatisfaction. The reviewer's exclamation (""wth"") further emphasizes their negative experience. The mention of multiple complaints from other patrons suggests a systemic issue.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Well the food was OK at best. Middle of the road BBQ is giving it to much credit. I'm not a famous Dave fan but its better. Man I miss Missouri.. Reasoning: The review uses phrases like ""OK at best,"" ""Middle of the road,"" and ""not a fan,"" which indicate disappointment and a lack of enthusiasm. The comparison to Famous Dave's, positioning this establishment as *worse* than a chain restaurant, is particularly damning. The longing for Missouri BBQ further underscores a negative experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I attended Mass while in Vegas on business. The deacon asks visitors to stand before Mass and introduces / welcomes you to the church community. I thought this was very thoughtful. There are no kneelers so you stand when you would normally kneel. The altar is in the middle of the room with everyone facing in which was nice. There was no crucifix so I know that would have bothered my wife had she been with me but all in all I really enjoyed Mass. Felt very inviting and comfortable.. Reasoning: The review expresses overall positive feelings despite a minor detail (lack of a crucifix) that would have impacted the reviewer's wife. Phrases like ""very thoughtful,"" ""nice,"" ""really enjoyed,"" ""felt very inviting and comfortable"" strongly indicate a positive experience. The negative mention is presented as a potential issue for someone else, not the reviewer directly, further reinforcing the positive overall sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I'm a snob when it comes to restaurant service. I expect good service and tip accordingly. The service did not disappoint. The food, however, needs some major revamping. I had a half a rack of their supposedly award winning baby back ribs. The meat was dry and had absolutely no flavor. The two sides I ordered were the fried okra and the mac and cheese. The mac and cheese looked and tasted like it came out of a Kraft Mac and Cheese box. Also had the three item sampler: onion straws, fried pickles, and burnt ends. I kid you not,. Reasoning: While the reviewer explicitly praises the service (""The service did not disappoint"" and awards a ""Plus one star for the service experienced""), the overwhelming majority of the review details significant and harsh criticisms of the food. Descriptions like ""dry,"" ""no flavor,"" ""looked and tasted like it came out of a Kraft Mac and Cheese box,"" and ""puddle of oil"" are exceptionally negative. The concluding statement, ""Will definitely not be returning to this place,"" seals the negative overall impression. The single positive aspect is outweighed by the substantial negative feedback.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I have tried several places in town until I finally found this place, and I don't think I would be going elsewhere. I have extremely small nails and it must be a major pain in the butt to do them all, but those girls do it just fine without complaining. It's past their business hours (Sunday 6:05pm) but my technician is still working hard to perfect my toes. I feel blessed to have found this place, and I recommend this place to anyone I know. 37 bucks to get an hour long pedicure accompanied with twenty min massage... and this. Reasoning: The review expresses overwhelming positivity. The user explicitly states they won't go elsewhere (""I don't think I would be going elsewhere""), feels ""blessed"" to have found the place, and recommends it to others. They also praise the technicians' dedication and skill, and highlight the excellent value and long-lasting results. The enthusiastic tone and strong positive language leave no doubt about the reviewer’s satisfaction.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: If you're a dude, expect an awesome service. Female? you're better off asking your guy friends to order for you. Haha.\n\nWent here one time with a friend. She got \""discriminated\"" or that's what she thought. Well, she was sitting at the end of the bar where the bartenders couldn't see her!\n\nDrinks are okay priced at $6.50. Went here on a Saturday night. Thank god, no cover! They were pretty much playing traditional country and pop country.\n\nWould come back here with a group of guy friends rather than women.. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative despite some neutral or mildly positive mentions. The primary and most significant aspect is the blatant discriminatory comment regarding service based on gender. The reviewer explicitly states a female patron felt ""discriminated"" and that women are better off having men order for them, which is a serious accusation and reflects a deeply negative experience. While the price of drinks and the music are mentioned neutrally, the overriding tone and central complaint about discriminatory service make the overall sentiment negative. The concluding statement reinforcing the preference for a male-only group further solidifies this negative perception.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: We took the south rim Grand Canyon tour. The bus is smaller and more intimate than most other tour companies, the driver and guide was fantastic and knowledgeable.\n\nIt started with pick-up at our hotel, we were provided a light breakfast when we boarded which included a juice and pastry. We picked up one other passenger and were off. Because there was only 3 people on the tour she let us stop at the welcome to las vegas sign to take pictures. \n\nThe drive was long, but the scenery made it go by quickly. When we got to the canyon she. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses words like ""fantastic,"" ""great,"" and explicitly states they ""would definitely use pink jeep for future tours."" They highlight numerous positive aspects of the tour, including the small bus size, the guide's knowledge, the provided breakfast and lunch (describing the lunch as ""huge""), and the opportunity for scenic stops and hiking. There are no negative comments or criticisms present.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: My brother and I were supposed to go to a movie but ended up stopping by here for lunch. Never made it to the movie but they had good pizza and my brother swears by their ranch.. Reasoning: While the review mentions missing a movie (which could be seen as slightly negative), the focus is on the positive experience with the food. The phrases ""good pizza"" and ""swears by their ranch"" clearly indicate enjoyment and satisfaction. The initial circumstance (missing the movie) is presented as a change of plans rather than a complaint about the establishment itself.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: The front office supervisor is incredibly rude. Sad that my mom went to this office for years and this is how I am treated. Not only did my mom never get an accurate diagnosis when the entire world knew she had dementia, but now I am dealing with someone raising my own blood pressure. Ridiculous.. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly negative. The language used is highly critical and expresses strong dissatisfaction. Phrases like ""incredibly rude,"" ""sad,"" ""never get an accurate diagnosis,"" and ""raising my own blood pressure"" indicate significant negative experiences and emotional distress. The reference to the mother's past experiences further emphasizes a history of poor service.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: One day Brett came in to my store ( Home Depot ) with his family to rent a tool. I recognized him since I watch the show. I happened to help him since he was next in line. He was really a nice guy and very friendly. When I helped him to his car since the tool he rented was very heavy to lift. We chatted for a bit. Before going, he said for me to come in to the shop for a tour of the shop. Of course I accepted. Days later I went to the shop. Someone at. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive. The author describes Brett (ATM) as ""really a nice guy and very friendly,"" highlights his follow-through on his offer for a tour, and emphasizes the friendliness of everyone they interacted with. The descriptions of the tour itself – seeing exotic fish, birds, and the tank-making area – all contribute to a positive and enjoyable experience. There are no negative comments or criticisms.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: We needed a plumber to replace our pressure reducing valve\nA friend told me about Colburn Enterprise - best thing that could happen to us\nJohn came out check the valve - replaced it - asked use if we had any question on anything\nGreat Guy - Great Service - Great price\nI will be recommending Colburn Enterprises to all my friends and neighbors who might need a plumber!\nThey are the best in my book by far!!. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""best thing that could happen to us,"" ""Great Guy,"" ""Great Service,"" ""Great price,"" and ""the best in my book by far!!"" clearly indicate a very positive experience. The reviewer's intention to recommend the company further reinforces this positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Got home found water softner leaking. Called a few places and looked online. Saw the yelp reviews and decided to give a try since there's only good things about this place. Also. They had the $40 voucher .. What a deal since majority of all the places I called had around that a high cost to come by and check it out. Although Jeremy was backed up in prior appts the secretary updated me on what time he was able to come! I reAlly thought that was awesome! Great customer service! Jeremy was very helpful and explained what happened to. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive. While there's a mention of a minor inconvenience (Jeremy being backed up), the reviewer highlights numerous positive aspects including good Yelp reviews leading them to choose the business, a favorable voucher price, excellent communication from the secretary, Jeremy's helpfulness, politeness, and overall great customer service. The concluding statement about keeping the number for future recommendations solidifies the positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: We won't be going again.\n\nI was really craving the Dutch Baby - which is stellar, and I decided to treat my two boys to breakfast there yesterday morning.\n\nThe service was good. We were seated right away, and our waitress was spot on, as far as service goes.\n\nMy oldest son requires gluten-free food. Normally, for breakfast, this is never an issue. Eggs, bacon and potatoes are easy, and he loves them.\n\nBoth of my sons ordered the bacon and eggs for breakfast, and both asked to substitute the 3 pancakes for the potatoes. She said SURE! Guess what? Not only was the. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative despite acknowledging a positive element (the Dutch Baby). The reviewer expresses strong dissatisfaction with hidden upcharges, overcooked bacon, a gluten reaction in their son, and generally mediocre food quality for the price. The closing statement, ""Never again,"" seals the negative sentiment. While the service is mentioned as ""good,"" and the Dutch Baby itself is praised, these positive aspects are overshadowed by the numerous negative experiences detailed.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: My youngest son's future Father-In-Law had Breakfast at this Original Pancake House location yesterday... the very first time I've been to an OPH, even when I was living here... I was just shaking with anticipation of a great Breakfast.\n\nOn the menu...\n\nIrish Corned Beef Hash (***) A Homemade Hash, with a blend of Kosher Corned Beef, Potatoes, Onions and Cream. This entree, under the category \""Specialties of the House\"" should have been rated under two-Stars, but because of it's heftiness the concoction provides a Value deserving of something a litte higher. All the \""Specialties\"" are Oven-Baked... I asked the waitress what. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative, despite the reviewer's initial anticipation. While they award a few stars (***) for the Corned Beef Hash and Coffee, these are qualified with caveats (""mainly because it was not objectionable""). The extensive criticism of the pancakes, with detailed explanations of why they fail on multiple criteria (heaviness, poor syrup absorption), dominates the review. The mention that the location is supposedly the worst in Las Vegas, and the lengthy, detailed critique, points to a significantly disappointing experience. The initial excitement and expectation are starkly contrasted with the actual outcome.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: German pancakes, Swedish pancakes, one side of sausages, two coffees for. $34. Way too high for OK food. Long wait to get table when only few customers eating and had to ask someone to send waitress to take order. Would not return.. Reasoning: The review contains several negative indicators. The user explicitly states the price is ""Way too high,"" the food is only ""OK"" (not great), and they experienced a ""long wait"" and poor service (having to ask for a waitress). The concluding statement ""Would not return"" is a strong indicator of dissatisfaction. While the mention of specific food items is factual, the overall tone and expressed experience are negative.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: This place used to be good... About a year or more ago. It seems to me they have changed ownership or management or something. The food quality is bad now. They have a menu item that has a bunch of bacon. The bacon used to be crispy and thick not it couldn't be more thin and under cooked. They give you a huge plate with two items on it and it makes it look like they forgot part of your meal. I've tried everything here. Nothing is good. \n\nI had the sausage and hash browns. The hash was undercooked (despite. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer mentions the service is ""fine,"" this is overshadowed by extensive complaints about the food quality. They specifically detail multiple issues – poor food preparation (undercooked hash browns, cold sausage, thin/undercooked bacon), low-quality ingredients (cheap syrup substitute), and a decline in standards compared to past experiences. The concluding statement about not returning unless absolutely necessary and the comparison to other breakfast places further solidifies the negative sentiment. The explicit mention of a 3/5 star rating also indicates dissatisfaction.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Had the worst experience I've ever had in my life. General manager was super rude when I asked him to substitute pancakes to something else, he said he have to charge me but He can give me maybe a \""SLICE OF TOMATO\"" for free. \""In his own words\"" Like seriously, was that necessary & having a attitude on Saturday afternoon & you happen to be the GENERAL MANAGER? No wonder this place gets bad reviews. It's these people make the restaurant look bad. But food can't save this Original pancake house ANYWAY. I fell the like the GM hated his. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer uses extremely strong language (""worst experience I've ever had,"" ""super rude,"" ""Worst taste of pancakes I've ever had,"" ""WILL NOT RETURN""). They specifically criticize the general manager's behavior and attitude, and directly link the poor service to the restaurant’s reputation. The reviewer also expresses dissatisfaction with the food itself. There are no positive aspects mentioned.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: The food was excellent. Vegetarian omelets and banana and pumpkin pancakes. Our server, Mary was amazing, attentive and very accommodating and caring.. We will certainly be back again. Thanks Mary and thanks Original Pancake House,. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Words like ""excellent,"" ""amazing,"" ""attentive,"" ""caring,"" and the declaration ""We will certainly be back again"" clearly indicate a highly favorable experience. The specific praise for both the food and the server further reinforces the positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Items Selected:\nChocolate Chip Buttermilk Short Stack\nChallah French Toast\nBaked Apple Pancake\n\nTechnically a chain, with origins in Portland OR and the famous Walker Bros location in Wilmette IL, it was only when Groupon offered a discount that I realized Las Vegas even had an Original Pancake House and although I guess it could be said that the $8 discount was the impetus for my visit, in reality it was fond childhood memories that drew me through the doors. Located on Fort Apache, and thus less than ten minutes from my door, it was after another long morning run that I arrived at. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly positive. While the reviewer acknowledges it's a chain and mentions the Groupon discount as the initial impetus, the tone throughout is enthusiastic and appreciative. They highlight positive aspects like friendly service, a bustling atmosphere, the quality of ingredients (""93-score butter, pure whipping cream, and free-range eggs""), and the deliciousness of the pancakes, specifically praising the challah French toast and the baked apple pancake. The phrase ""something about Original Pancake House that makes me smile"" is a clear indicator of positive sentiment. Even the potential for a ""blistered mouth"" from the hot apple pancake is presented playfully.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: 5 dollar foot long. Reasoning: The review simply states a price point (""5 dollar foot long""). There's no expression of opinion or feeling about the food or service. It's purely informational.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: Apparently, my wife and I are invisible! We arrived at about 1:30 on a Thursday afternoon, pleased to see so many cars parked in the lot. The place is divided into separate rooms for dining and for a bar area. We went into the eating area and waited, and waited, but no one ever came. The one couple who were eating said to just take a table and the waitress would be in. After more waiting,a group of 5 entered the eating area. They were immediately seated, given menus, and had their drink orders taken. The waitress never acknowledged that. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer initially expresses pleasure at seeing a full parking lot, the entire rest of the review details a shockingly poor and dismissive experience with the staff. Phrases like ""invisible,"" ""waited, and waited,"" ""never acknowledged,"" and ""carefully putting her back to us"" clearly convey frustration and a sense of being ignored and disrespected. The concluding statement that they left and found another place reinforces the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: First time here ... it was alright. i ordered the chicken kabob nothing special and nothing bad. The service seemed kinda slow. Chicken was tender the rice tasted buttery. Give it a try you might like it. For me i think i will pass next time.. Reasoning: The review contains a mixed bag of comments. While the reviewer states ""it was alright"" and notes positive aspects like ""chicken was tender"" and ""rice tasted buttery,"" they also mention ""nothing special,"" ""kinda slow"" service, and ultimately indicate they won't return (""i think i will pass next time""). The overall tone leans towards a lukewarm experience, not strongly positive nor strongly negative.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: Awesome service here! The lady who took my order was very kind and helpful! I LOVE it when I have great service at any place (shops, restaurants, etc)\n\nI wanted to eat outside and she was more than willing to bring my food out side for me (after I told her I was eating inside when ordering.) But I decided to be spontaneous since it was a nice day out (yet windy.) One of the many reasons why I had to go back in to give them a tip $, since it was rather windy outside. I'll be back! :) I. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""Awesome service,"" ""very kind and helpful,"" ""I LOVE it,"" and ""great food"" clearly indicate a positive experience. While there's a minor mention of windiness and forgetting a discount (indicated by "":(""), these are presented as minor inconveniences and don't detract from the overall enthusiastic tone. The reviewer explicitly states they will return and expresses satisfaction with the food.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: WORST JEWELER IN TOWN.... I purchased a ring from my Jewler in California and brought it in to get resized... Something as simple as that and thought I could trust them to do it... They seem like a trustworthy Jewler... So I thought. When I went back to pick up my ring the Jewler in the process had scratched the glass on the ring they said that they would fix it.. When I came back almost a month and a half later my beautiful ring was ruined. I got it back with the jewlers finger print on the inside of. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The language used is highly critical (""WORST JEWELER,"" ""ruined,"" ""worst experience,"" ""pissed""). The reviewer details a series of failures – failing to properly resize the ring, scratching the glass, leaving fingerprints and epoxy on the ring, and then offering a dismissive and unapologetic response to the complaint. The explicit statement of never returning and refusing to recommend the jeweler further solidifies the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: The foods not for fast food Chinese. It's not as greasy as some that I've had before, so it passes.. Reasoning: The review uses phrases like ""not as greasy"" and ""it passes,"" indicating a baseline level of acceptability but not enthusiastic praise. The initial statement that it's ""not for fast food Chinese"" suggests a lowered expectation. Overall, it conveys a sense of mild satisfaction rather than excitement or disappointment.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral

Words like ""very good,"" ""good quality,"" ""great service,"" and ""great cocktails"" all indicate a positive experience. There are no negative indicators or qualifiers to detract from this.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: California comes to Vegas! This place is like the restaurants in California, but better. It's open 24/7 363 days a year (closed on Easter and Christmas) I'm usually here on there graveyard shift or sometimes early dinner. Great food and affordable. Look for discounts in the Entertainment Book!. Reasoning: The reviewer uses highly positive language like ""better,"" ""great,"" and expresses enthusiasm (""California comes to Vegas!""). The fact that they frequent the establishment, especially during unconventional hours, and recommend looking for discounts further reinforces a positive experience. There are no negative comments or criticisms present.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Used to shop this CVS almost everyday when I lived just a couple of footsteps away. The supervisor that was there, Lisa, was really cool and like a friend. Not certain she is still there. The rest of the staff is pretty cool too.\n\nStore is always clean and neat and they typically have some of the best fire sales outside of grocery stores and liquor stores.\n\nWhen I lived out here two years ago, they did have a reputation of hiring some seedy folks. Had one, I'm pretty certain, steal my debit card number and my niece and sister both told. Reasoning: This review presents a mixed bag of experiences. While the reviewer expresses fondness for a former supervisor (""really cool and like a friend"") and appreciates the store's cleanliness, sales, and convenience, they also recount concerning incidents involving potential theft and employee misconduct. The positive aspects are tempered by these negative experiences. The phrasing indicates a generally positive memory, but with significant caveats.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: I stopped to get a quick bite to eat and wasn't disappointed. Beef chow mein is delcious, it's not the bland stuff you'll find at similar joints. Orange chicken is also A grade. Service was quick to us and quick to deliver.. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""wasn't disappointed,"" ""delicious,"" ""A grade,"" and ""quick to us and quick to deliver"" clearly indicate a favorable experience.

There are no negative comments or criticisms.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Really not good. I would never come back here. The wait staff was attentive but the food was gross. I don't know why they have an overall 4 stars.. Reasoning: The review uses strongly negative language like ""Really not good,"" ""never come back,"" and ""gross."" While acknowledging attentive wait staff is a minor positive, the overwhelming sentiment revolves around a very poor experience with the food. The commenter's confusion about the restaurant's rating further reinforces their negative assessment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative

"Review: We have been taking our pets to the vet at American Pet Hospital for more than 8 years. Recently, our beloved family dog became ill with cancer and we had to put him to sleep. The entire staff at APH was amazing throughout the entire experience, from diagnosis, to our last trip. Today, we received a sympathy card from them in the mail. Our hearts were touched, but imagine how surprised we were to open that card and see that many of the staff members had written personal messages to us! (We often used their boarding services, so many of.

"Review: This place is great. When we first went there, we weren't sure how the food would be, but we were extremely happy with the quality & amount of food, and the pricing was great, too. You can get several dinner specials for just $7.95 +tax, which comes with a drink, soup, and an egg roll.\n\nThe main reason I'm so impressed with Mr. Chop Chop, though, is that when my other half went in the other night to pick up dinner, the owner pointed out that we were just in the day before. He mentioned that I wasn't feeling well, and. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Words like ""great,"" ""extremely happy,"" ""fantastic,"" and phrases like ""you won't be disappointed"" clearly indicate a very favorable experience. The anecdote about the owner going above and beyond to make soup for the reviewer's sick partner is a strong indicator of exceptional service and a truly positive sentiment. There are no negative comments or criticisms present.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Totally hole in the wall type of restaurant. \n\nI had a calamari appetizer and pad thai. The calamari was really good but the sauce needs to be a bit spicier. The pad thai was not great, the noodles was too chewy. I thought it was undercooked. \n\nThe price is perfect, not that expensive for their lunch specials. BUT quality is just not that good for me.. Reasoning: The review contains both positive and negative aspects. The reviewer explicitly states the calamari was ""really good"" which is positive. However, they found the pad thai ""not great"" and described textural issues (""chewy,"" ""undercooked""). The comment about the price being perfect is a minor positive. Ultimately, the concluding statement, ""quality is just not that good for me,"" weighs more heavily, indicating a generally unsatisfactory experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: This place came highly recommended from a co-worker but we ended up being disappointed. We showed up at 6:45 and they were already cleaning the grill for the night.. not sure when they close, but we probably should have taken it as a sign and kept walking. \n\nBecause it was \""late\"" we could only get sandwiches.. no fries, etc. Luckily you get to eat in a gas station, sooo you do have a great selection of chips.. whoo. The steaks were just OK. At $6.95 for a small, they are a tad pricey and honestly I think capriottis makes a. Reasoning: The review uses negative language like ""disappointed,"" ""should have kept walking,"" and ""skip this one."" While there's a small attempt at humor regarding the gas station setting and chip selection, this doesn't outweigh the overall negative assessment of the experience, particularly regarding the limited menu and the perceived poor value of the steaks. The comparison to Capriotti's further highlights the reviewer's dissatisfaction.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: There are no \""sandwich artisans\"" here, just friendly people who care about what they put across their counter. If you are looking for a place where you are served with a smile by people who really take pride in their work, then this place is for you. The bread is great and the sandwiches taste like they should. This is a great kept secret in town and it's too bad. They could compete with any of the chain locations. It has an old school neighborhood feel and you can't get away from the charming staff. This is a family run. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""friendly people who care,"" ""served with a smile,"" ""really take pride in their work,"" ""great bread,"" ""taste like they should,"" ""great kept secret,"" ""charming staff,"" ""family feel,"" and ""character"" all contribute to a highly favorable impression. The reviewer explicitly recommends the roast beef sandwich, reinforcing the positive experience. Even the comment about it being a ""kept secret"" implies it’s something desirable and valuable.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: So this review has nothing to do with the food as my sandwich was delicious. However, the service rubbed me the wrong way. I came to order some lunch with a coworker and was next in line to order. A man, who I assume was a regular customer, was standing behind me. Rather than take my order the cashier asked the man behind me what he wanted that day and completely ignored the fact that I was standing right in front of her. It was SO rude! Way to wow a new customer. I won't be going back. There are. Reasoning: While the reviewer explicitly states the food was ""delicious,"" the overwhelming tone of the review focuses on a highly negative experience with the service. The reviewer uses strong, negative language like ""rubbed me the wrong way,"" ""SO rude,"" and ""Way to wow a new customer."" The explicit statement of not returning and seeking alternatives further reinforces the negative sentiment. The positive comment about the food is ultimately outweighed by the frustration and disappointment expressed regarding the customer service.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: The creamy shrimp soup is an absolute must have. Everything else I've had is good but a little expensive for your average Chinese restaurant. Staff is always friendly.. Reasoning: While the reviewer mentions the food being ""a little expensive,"" the overwhelming praise for the shrimp soup (""absolute must have"") and the acknowledgement that ""everything else...is good"" indicates a largely positive experience. The friendly staff also contributes to the positive impression. The price concern is a minor drawback compared to the overall positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Service was good fast and just like I like it and those who've read me know I like my cheese stakes. Reasoning: The reviewer explicitly states the service was ""good"" and ""just like I like it,"" indicating satisfaction. The reference to ""those who've read me know"" suggests a personal connection and a preference being met, further reinforcing a positive experience. While the ""cheese stakes"" comment is unusual, it doesn't detract from the overall positive tone.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: My brother, his girlfriend and I went here and were so impressed. The couple who run the center were knowledgeable, friendly and so helpful. They have a true passion for inspiring people to be climbers. As a novice, I found many routes I enjoyed and challenged me. I highly recommend this gym!. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Words like ""impressed,"" ""friendly,"" ""helpful,"" ""passion,"" ""enjoyed,"" and ""highly recommend"" clearly indicate a very positive experience. There are no negative comments or criticisms present.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: The Place is nice the bartenders are good at there job descent food and separate smoking area. Reasoning: The review uses positive descriptors like ""nice"" and ""good,"" indicating satisfaction with the atmosphere and service. While ""descent food"" is not overly enthusiastic, it's not negative either. The mention of a separate smoking area is a practical benefit. Overall, the tone leans towards a pleasant experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Better than taco bell. Reasoning: The review explicitly states the establishment is ""better than Taco Bell,"" which is generally considered a baseline for fast-food Mexican cuisine. This comparison, even a simple one, implies a positive experience relative to a common benchmark. It's a low bar, but it's still a positive statement.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Staff is rude food is not good. I have been there a few times and have had to take fries back because they were so old or had to go get the rest of my order. Go to another one much better service and better food. Reasoning: This review contains overwhelmingly negative language. The reviewer explicitly states the staff is ""rude,"" the food is ""not good,"" and details repeated issues with order accuracy and food quality (""old fries,"" needing to retrieve orders). The concluding recommendation to go elsewhere reinforces the negative experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Yuk! Couldn't even chew the steak. I love del taco but never have I experience such a disgusting meal. Didn't get past the first bite.. Reasoning: The review uses extremely negative language (""Yuk!"", ""disgusting,"" ""couldn't even chew""). The reviewer explicitly states a negative experience and was unable to even finish the meal. This indicates a strongly negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: This review is for the Casino at the Longhorn. I've never stayed in the motel part, and the restaurant is actually called the Chuckwagon. I already left my review for it there. Seriously, check out my review. The Chuckwagon restaurant is a Vegas staple.\n\n-----\n\nI have given up Gambling (I like craps, blackjack, and video poker just a little too much) but before i quit, the Longhorn was one of my favorite places to play. They have a lot of slots and video poker, with much better payout rates than the Strip or Fremont. (Slots are always a bad bet, but. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive despite acknowledging some drawbacks. The reviewer expresses a strong fondness for the casino (""still love it""), praises the favorable gambling rules (""amazing""), and highlights the better payout rates compared to other casinos. While acknowledging issues like the karaoke performers, the smoke, and occasional drink service delays, these are presented as minor inconveniences within the context of a beloved, classic, ""locals joint"" experience. The overall tone is nostalgic and appreciative.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: How to describe the Longhorn....It is Vegas's version of the neighborhood dive bar. small, crowded, smoky (but it isn't), but for some reason it's comfortable...The really reason for coming here is the food, seriously, I have been eating here for 20 plus years and have yet to have a bad meal, the ribs are good, the specials can be great, though understand, you're paying $9 for steak and lobster, you will never get prime steak and you will never get a large lobster tail for that price, a reality check is needed by some.\n\nAnyways, the food is good, the drinks. Reasoning: While the review acknowledges some potentially negative aspects (small, crowded, smoky - though it clarifies the smoky part isn't accurate), the overwhelming tone is positive. The reviewer emphasizes the consistent quality of the food (""20 plus years and have yet to have a bad meal""), praises the cheap drinks and low-limit gambling, and even provides a humorous, endearing analogy to make the experience more appealing. The final encouragement to ""give it a shot"" and the suggestion that one will leave happy solidifies the positive sentiment. The humorous aside about the burgers being ""beef...not ketchup"" is a quirky detail that reinforces. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: old school Vegas there's not to Many of these left.Portions and food are great for the price (All I'm saying is the food is good for the price) The bar is a bit older the bar tenders are nice and easy to talk to and the beer and shots are cheap good place for the money only cons are the smoke (it gets in your cloths) and the occasional boulder highway scum that ventures in.. Reasoning: The review expresses a generally positive sentiment despite mentioning some drawbacks. The reviewer praises the portions, food quality relative to the price, friendly bartenders, and affordable drinks. While they note the smoke and mention ""occasional boulder highway scum,"" these are presented as minor inconveniences rather than deal-breakers. The repeated emphasis on value (""good for the price,"" ""good place for the money"") strongly indicates a positive overall impression.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: No, no, no, no no!!!\n\nNo water except on jug on each nine. Saw cart girl once in four hours. Greens are terrible. Bumpy, no grass, poorly maintained. I'd never play this course again. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly negative language (""No, no, no, no no!!!"", ""terrible"", ""bumpy"", ""poorly maintained""). The writer expresses strong dissatisfaction with multiple aspects of the course (water, service, greens). The concluding statement, ""I'd never play this course again,"" is a definitive expression of negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I don't golf. But I live here.. Reasoning: This review expresses a lack of engagement with the core activity (golf) but offers a seemingly benign reason – residency. It doesn't express any negative feelings about the establishment itself, nor does it offer any praise. It's simply an observation.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: I can't say I was thrilled with Billy Bob's Steakhouse, but its probably because i ordered the wrong dish: Coconut Chicken Tenders...definitely not a great combination. Service was great, our waiter Toni was a total sweetheart. Virgin strawberry margaritas are delish (a little on the tangy side, just the way I like it). I feel like the menu was a little lacking...perhaps I'm just not cut out to be a meat and potatoes girl.. Reasoning: While the reviewer expresses disappointment with their dish choice (""not a great combination""), the overall tone is tempered by several positive aspects. They praise the service (""sweetheart"") and the drinks (""delish""). The self-deprecating comment about not being a ""meat and potatoes girl"" suggests the issue was with their selection rather than the restaurant itself. The language isn't overtly negative, and the positive elements contribute to a generally agreeable experience.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: Talk about bait and switch. Ads said prime rib dinner $9.99, steak and lobster dinner $11.99, steak and sea food dinner $13.99, etc. So we show up ask for the prime rib dinner, no prime rib dinner here, it's at the buffet... Strike one. Ok steak and lobster dinner $11.99 ... It's not available until 8pm. Strike two. Ok, steak and sea food dinner $13.99 ... We'll that's part of the early bird special.. It's 6 pm - strike three -your out! No early bird, no late bird, no prime rib. We end up having the queen cut prime rib. Reasoning: The review expresses significant frustration and disappointment. While the food itself isn't universally condemned (the roughy was ""good""), the reviewer's experience was overwhelmingly negative due to misleading advertising and a bait-and-switch tactic. Phrases like ""bait and switch,"" ""strike one/two/three,"" ""overprice meal,"" and ""doesn't give you a good taste in the overall experience"" clearly indicate dissatisfaction. The acknowledgment of some aspects being ""ok"" prevents a completely negative classification, but the core feeling is one of being misled and overcharged.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Well my wife and decided to try Willy and Jose's again. We first ate there about 6 yrs ago. So we decided to try it again.\nThis second visit 6 tears later confirms it. What an awful place.\nThey served us the usual tortilla chips, salsa and bean dip. The chips were old and hard. Bean dip .... Nothing to crow about. Salsa tasted canned. The wife ordered a strawberry margarita. More strawberry syrup and not enough booze. $ 8.00 for a $ 2.00 drink.\nWife ordered chicken enchiladas with mole. She enjoyed it.\nI ordered a 3 item combo. Pork tamale tasted fine. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer uses strongly negative descriptors like ""awful,"" ""dismal,"" ""garbage,"" and explicitly states they ""won't go back."" While one item (the chicken enchiladas) was enjoyed, it's a small positive point overshadowed by numerous criticisms of the food's quality, ingredients, and preparation. The comparison to a competitor (Roberto's) further emphasizes the reviewer's dissatisfaction.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Eek! Methinks not indeed. Is this place for you? Here's a checklist. If you like plates fresh out of the dishwasher that are still hot with crusted food on them, and this was with multiple plates, this is your buffet. If you are extremely sodium deficient this is your buffet. If you like carved meats that make you wish for a meat tenderizer to beat them with this is your buffet. If you like semi-frozen out of the box desserts this is definitely your buffet. Go slow on your drinks as getting a server to refill it is next to. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer acknowledges one positive – the stir-fry station and its staff – the rest of the description details numerous serious issues with the food (hot, crusted plates, tough meat, frozen desserts) and service (difficulty getting refills). The sarcastic and dismissive tone, particularly the comparison to Zagat ratings and the recommendation to eat elsewhere, solidifies the negative sentiment. The phrase ""the only thing that warrants a star"" emphasizes how few redeeming qualities the reviewer found.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: This place used to have awesome food. It was a great buffet. Then the location changed and I am guessing the cooks did too. The food was terrible. Buffets in Las Vegas that are good are slammed with people even the mediocre ones have lines. This place, was dead at 7 pm on a Wednesday. We go out to eat on Wednesdays and we sometimes go to Buffets. When we do go to Buffets they are slammed with people and have long lines. This place you just walk right on up, pay you money and go grab a plate. Problem. Reasoning: The review overwhelmingly expresses negative sentiment. While acknowledging a positive past experience (""used to have awesome food,"" ""great buffet""), the reviewer details a significant decline in quality. Phrases like ""terrible,"" ""nothing but food under the heat lamps that looked old,"" ""cooked well done,"" and ""whole place was terrible food"" are strong indicators of a negative experience. The reviewer also highlights the lack of patronage as evidence of the decline, contrasting it with typically busy, well-regarded buffets. The concluding statement about numerous better alternatives reinforces the negative assessment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I rarely leave poor reviews, but I came away quite disappointed with this buffet. I remember coming here many times years ago and loving it, but it seems they've taken a dive off a cliff. \n\nMy wife and I visited on a Friday night for their $20 seafood buffet. We tried the crab legs, New York steak, sushi, chow mein, broccoli beef, and tacos. Nothing we ate even came close to average. You're better off finding somewhere else to eat. The service was good, though. So there's that.. Reasoning: The review uses overtly negative language like ""disappointed,"" ""taken a dive off a cliff,"" and ""nothing we ate even came close to average."" While the reviewer acknowledges good service, the overwhelmingly negative assessment of the food quality dominates the review. The overall tone clearly conveys dissatisfaction.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: My reccomendation: Italian Cheese Bread\n\nMaybe I got there right after a big rush or something because absolutely nothing was \""hot-n-ready\"". I had to wait for my pizzas and italian cheese bread. Took about 15-20 minutes. \n\nI don't expect gourmet quality for a 5 dollar pizza, but geez, if they charged as much as other pizza places then Little Caesars would go out of business QUICK. Little Caesars pizza is strictly for someone looking for cheap/quick food. I honestly think most pizzas found in your local grocery store's freezers taste leagues above Caesars. \n\nThe Italian cheese bread is really good though.. Reasoning: This review is complex and contains both positive and negative elements. The writer expresses disappointment with the lack of ready-made pizza and criticizes the pizza's quality (""leagues above Caesars""). However, they strongly praise the Italian cheese bread, highlight good customer service, and appreciate the free Crazy Bread. The overall tone is mixed, but the emphasis on the positive aspects of the cheese bread and customer service, coupled with the acknowledgement of the value proposition (cheapness) ultimately leans towards a slightly positive experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: This is the worst hobby store in the valley Dave the manager or owner or whoever he is will rob you completely blind of every part that he wants and replace it with parts that look exactly the same as your parts but downgraded he took my truck home without my permission then conveniently went on vacation when he got back from vacation my truck was completely downgraded but then he tried to make me believe that I was seeing things even though I had video and photos that I taken before I took it in to prove otherwise. My. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The language is extremely harsh, filled with accusations of theft (""rob you completely blind""), unauthorized actions (""took my truck home without my permission""), damage (""cracked frame""), and deception (""tried to make me believe that I was seeing things""). The detailed description of the truck’s degradation and the comparison to a superior alternative (Eddie) reinforce the strongly negative experience. The repeated expressions of distress and a desperate warning to others leave no room for ambiguity.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: The food was very good and tasty. Portions were big and priced reasonably.. Reasoning: The review uses explicitly positive descriptors like ""very good,"" ""tasty,"" and ""reasonably priced."" The mention of ""big portions"" is also generally perceived as a positive attribute. There are no negative statements or criticisms present.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Attending the Cinemark Century Theatres at Sam's Town for the first time was an enjoyable experience. Although the slightly rocking chairs look well used, carpeting appears to be fairly new and sight lines are very good. My wife and I saw \""Midnight in Paris,\"" and the visual images reflected on the slightly curved screen from a digital projector were crystal clear, and the sound from multiple speakers loud. First Look was shown, and previews and the main attraction started on time. \n\nTicket prices were reasonable but confusing. They change by day of the week and time. Top price for all. Reasoning: The review contains a mix of positive and negative aspects. The reviewer explicitly states the experience was ""enjoyable"" and highlights positive elements like good sightlines, crystal-clear visuals, and timely showings. However, they also mention worn chairs, confusing ticket pricing, steep concession prices, and messy restrooms. The 3.5-star rating itself indicates a generally positive but flawed experience. The positive aspects outweigh the negative, leaning towards a favorable impression.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I like what this place does for my nails; especially my toenails. They are thick and hard to deal with at times. Whenever I ask for a design, they always accommodate and have not been rough on me at all.. Reasoning: The reviewer explicitly states they ""like"" the services and praises the salon's willingness to accommodate design requests. They also note a positive experience by mentioning the staff has not been rough. While acknowledging a challenge with their nail thickness, the overall tone is appreciative and positive.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I went to ER with terrible pain on my left side and it could barely breathe... My chest Xray was wrongly diagnosed and i was sent home from ER still in total pain... I had never been to the ER in my life so i went home thinking maybe i was being a baby about the pain.... 2 days later i woke up in the middle of the night in so much pain even worse than before... I told my husband to drive me to the ER and he was like \""Why, they didn't admit you last time?\"" I told. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer expresses significant distress and frustration with their experience, detailing a misdiagnosis, severe pain, a near-life-threatening situation, and now a large medical bill. The strong language (""Shame on..."", ""almost cost me my life"") and detailed account of suffering clearly indicate a highly negative sentiment. The reviewer's regret and implication that proper diagnosis earlier would have prevented a prolonged hospital stay further reinforces this.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: This is for their pharmacy...don't bother. \nThese days they are offering a 10% off coupon if you get your flu shot. OK.\nI stood in line 17 minutes on a Wednesday afternoon just to get a form to sign. I was told they didn't have any coupons, but I could leave my name and they would call me to come back for it. Excuse me? You have signs everywhere promoting this, but you can't figure out some way to give me the 10% off you are advertising because you don't have that exact piece of paper that magically reads 10% off???\nAfter. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer details a frustrating and time-consuming experience with multiple negative aspects: excessive wait times (17 minutes, then 21 minutes), conflicting information about a coupon, a dirty environment (""absolutely dirtiest carpet I have seen in years""), and a complete lack of apology for the poor service. The concluding statement expressing reluctance to trust them with important medications solidifies the negative sentiment. While the reviewer acknowledges the flu shot itself took only 20 seconds and a coupon was eventually provided, this is overshadowed by the overall negative experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: On the 12th day of Christmas...\n\nI thought it only fitting to review my church on Christmas Day. We've been parishioners at SEAS for over 19 years. My son attended first through eighth grade at their school. I've seen the parish grow from being in trailers to the build out of the church, school, and chapel. We've experienced a great deal of controversy and heartbreak in the past two years with our former pastor. All through this turmoil, the congregation is still strong, as I'm sure it would be in any other church, regardless of the denomination, where its parishioners have. Reasoning: While the reviewer mentions “controversy and heartbreak,” the overall tone is overwhelmingly positive. They highlight a long history of positive experiences (19 years as parishioners), acknowledge the strength of the community through difficult times, praise the welcoming nature of the staff and priests, and specifically praise a staff member (DeeDee). The concluding recommendation (""give St. Elizabeth's a try"") and the ""Peace"" sign-off further solidify a positive sentiment. The mention of past difficulties is presented as a testament to the church's resilience rather than a cause for negativity.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: If you want a doctor and staff who doesn't make you feel uncomfortable and won't make you dread having to take your child in for a visit, do not go here. I was a month late taking my infant daughter at the time to take her shots and Dr. Nauman would make a negative comment towards me for being late. I never felt comfortable going there. I wish I had found Dr. Marlon Mendoza much sooner.. Reasoning: The review expresses significant dissatisfaction with the doctor and staff. The phrases ""doesn't make you feel uncomfortable"" and ""won't make you dread"" are explicitly contrasted with the reviewer's actual experience. The criticism of Dr. Nauman’s comments (""negative comment towards me for being late"") and the overall feeling of discomfort clearly indicate a negative experience. The concluding statement expressing a wish to have found another doctor sooner reinforces this negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Just AWFUL... I was in town for a Bridal Shower and the service was horrible!! There was only 12 of us women and they couldn't get it together. They forgot to bring out 2 salads and missed 3 entrees. Our waiter Kevin was the worst and the manager Kelly was non-responsive. DO NOT ever plan a party here. I felt bad for the bride. The day was supposed to be about her, but everyone was focused on the slow, lousy, rude service. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer uses highly critical language (""AWFUL,"" ""horrible,"" ""worst,"" ""non-responsive,"" ""slow, lousy, rude""). They detail multiple significant service failures (forgotten salads, missed entrees) and express dissatisfaction with both the waiter and manager. The closing statement strongly advises against using the venue for events and expresses sympathy for the bride, highlighting the negative impact of the experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: When I enjoy the appetizers more than my entree, and have to wait a substantial amount of time between appetizers to my entree I think there is a problem.\nI usually don't like to rate bad, but personally I didn't enjoy my dinner.\nIt seems like a great place to nibble and drink mostly.. Reasoning: The review explicitly states the author ""didn't enjoy"" their dinner and highlights negative experiences (long wait time, appetizers being better than the entree). While acknowledging it might be good for appetizers and drinks, the overall impression is one of disappointment regarding the main course and service. The phrase ""I think there is a problem"" reinforces the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Wine selection is FANTASTIC!\nThis place is a hidden gem among those of us who love good food paired with good wine. \nService is OK when it gets busy Good when things are slow. I have had lunch and dinner there for a couple of years now and have never been disappointed.. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language (""FANTASTIC,"" ""hidden gem,"" ""never been disappointed""). While the service comment acknowledges a slight inconsistency (""OK when it gets busy""), it's presented as a minor point and doesn't detract from the overall positive experience. The repeated visits over a couple of years also indicate consistent satisfaction.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: This restaurant is a jewel in the city of Las Vegas. I urge all to experience a meal here. I am surprised at the wide range of flavors that come out of one kitchen. I have been here at least 10 times and haven't been disappointed once! Some may comment on the prices at first but once you see the portion sizes such as their veal parmesan portion it is actually a deal! They offer other incentives like coupons on restaurant.com (make sure you read the fine print), and Mondays are half off all bottles of wine. Dine in then. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""jewel in the city,"" ""urge all to experience,"" ""haven't been disappointed once,"" and ""actually a deal"" clearly indicate a very favorable opinion. While the reviewer acknowledges potential concerns about pricing, they actively refute it and highlight additional benefits (coupons, wine specials). The final encouragement to tell friends further solidifies the positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: they have a pretty extensive menu, you would find something to eat pretty easy. The appetizers come in pretty big portions and their food is very Delicious. They also have an extend wine menu.. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""pretty extensive menu,"" ""pretty easy,"" ""pretty big portions,"" and crucially ""very Delicious"" all indicate a positive experience. The mention of an ""extend wine menu"" also suggests a desirable offering. There are no negative comments or criticisms present.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Terrible! All of the reviews about the poor service were absolutely correct. We went on a Saturday for lunch and there were only a few tables in the restaurant and he appeared as though he was very busy. My mother and I were treated poorly. The server was short with us, had no personality and was not very helpful for this being my first time. The food was below par, the only good thing about it was the free basket if bread that is served with each meal. We had to go inside to get our check because our server. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer uses strong negative descriptors like ""Terrible,"" ""poorly,"" ""short,"" ""no personality,"" and ""below par."" They detail specific instances of bad service and express a firm intention not to return. The single positive mention (free bread basket) is overshadowed by the extensive list of complaints.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I enjoyed a nice manicotti dinner here tonight. We had a group of 12 and I believe everyone enjoyed dinner. Some nice specials were offered. Prices were reasonable.. Reasoning: The review uses positive language like ""enjoyed,"" ""nice,"" and ""believe everyone enjoyed."" It highlights positive aspects such as specials and reasonable prices. There are no negative comments or criticisms present.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I love this place and have been going here for years it's perfect for an intimate date night or even a friends night out.\n\nFirst thing you should know about this gem is that Monday night is 1/2 off bottle wine night and the second thing you should know is that the food is delicious! \n\nWhen you walk in you'll notice a private dining room to the left, the patio to the right and a sweet dimly light dining room with a cool little wine bar right in the middle. Towards the back you'll notice the neatly stored wine. It's pretty. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""I love this place,"" ""perfect for,"" ""gem,"" ""delicious,"" ""sweet,"" ""fabulous,"" ""hospitable,"" and ""knowledgable"" are all indicators of a positive experience. While the reviewer mentions a single negative experience with service, it's presented as an exception and doesn't overshadow the overall enthusiastic tone. The recommendation at the end (""give this place a try! It will probably be a new favorite"") solidifies the positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: We've been here a couple of times. Food is always good and so is the service. We'll definitely be back..

"Review: Best spot in town. This is such a romantic spot to take friends or even family. I fell upon this place over 4 years ago and i keep coming back. Love the wide selection of wine (that I can now drink) and the authentic Italian food. Great place to wine and dine without having to go to the strip. They have also just opened a second location at the Downtown Summerlin Mall. Right next door to me!. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""Best spot in town,"" ""romantic spot,"" ""keep coming back,"" ""Love the...wine and authentic Italian food,"" and ""Great place"" clearly indicate a very favorable opinion. The reviewer's enthusiasm and personal connection to the establishment (having been a patron for 4 years and the new location being nearby) further reinforce the positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: It was my first time:\n\nVery attentive staff. \n\nYou will not benefit much from making an appointment because there are only a few techs. You may have to sit in a massage chair & soak for a bit but I don't mind the extra time with a massager at all! \n\nI would like it if they had prices & services I could read up on but I'm not shy or afraid to ask. I was explained very well any questions I had. \n\nI went in at 6 (close at seven) they stayed until almost 8 to make sure everyone was happy.. Reasoning: The review contains overwhelmingly positive language. The reviewer highlights attentive staff, willingness to accommodate by staying open late, and ultimately expresses satisfaction with the service received. While there are minor suggestions for improvement (lack of readily available pricing), these are presented as preferences rather than criticisms and are balanced by the positive experiences described. The phrase ""very satisfied"" strongly indicates a positive overall experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I have been seeing Dr. Weisner for various ailments since May of 2000. He has helped me recover from a serious car injury, and allowed me lead an active an healthy lifestyle. \n\nAlways very professional and willing to spend time with you. Great staff as well!. Reasoning: The review expresses a long-standing and highly positive relationship with Dr. Weisner, detailing significant positive impacts on the reviewer's health and lifestyle (""helped me recover,"" ""active and healthy lifestyle""). The reviewer also praises his professionalism and the quality of the staff. This constitutes strong positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Small, but had the basics with good quality. Reasoning: The review acknowledges a negative aspect (""small"") but immediately balances it with positives (""had the basics"" and ""good quality""). The overall tone leans towards acceptance and appreciation for the positives outweighing the minor drawback.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: So this place is poppin!! \n\nI don't really drink SB. So I can't say that I'm a connoisseur for it, but I enjoy a stroowberries & creme every 2nd Friday of the month ;] jk.\n\nThe people are chilled out like ice in my sweet tea. Star 1.\n\nSmells good & looks clean. Star 2.\n\nThe location is pretty sweet. Lots of good eats *ahem In-N-Out* around :] Star 3.\n\nLike I said, it's poppin! Star 4!\n\nOnly dislike is the parking isn't the best. I mean it's too late to do anything about it, but it's part of the review, nah mean? 4 Stars. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language (""poppin,"" ""chilled out,"" ""sweet,"" ""good,"" ""clean""). While the reviewer acknowledges a minor drawback (parking), it’s presented casually and doesn't detract from the overall positive impression. The use of emojis and informal language further reinforces the positive tone. The final 4-star rating confirms a positive experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Best grocery store in Vegas!. Reasoning: The review uses superlative language (""Best"") which clearly indicates a highly positive opinion. There are no negative words or phrases present.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: This trader joes is awesome!! Its not that much larger than the others but I feel like this particular one has more of a selection of items then the others do. Clean as all trader joes usually are. Staff was very friendly and helpful. It was very busy but I guess its no surprise as this trader joes is a great one!. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Words like ""awesome,"" ""great,"" and phrases like ""friendly and helpful staff"" clearly indicate a positive experience. The reviewer explicitly states this Trader Joe's is a ""great one"" despite acknowledging it's similar to others. There are no negative comments or complaints present.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I'm conflicted about this Trader Joe's. They are always crowded, I have never been here without encountering entirely too many people, no matter what time of day. I try to avoid coming here when I can, but the good part about this Trader Joe's is that it's larger and better stocked than the other locations in town. I'm not a fan of the layout of the store. It's long and there are essentially three long aisles that span the entire length of the store, which is a little awkward.\n\nI don't make it to this Trader Joe's too often, but when. Reasoning: The review presents a mixed bag of opinions. While the reviewer expresses frustration with the crowds and the store's layout (""awkward,"" ""avoid coming here when I can""), they also highlight a significant positive – the larger size and better stock compared to other locations. The final statement indicates a willingness to travel to the store when needed, suggesting the positive aspects outweigh the negative enough to warrant a visit. The overall tone isn't overwhelmingly positive or negative.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: I had a crazy acne flare up a few years ago. I researched derms and found a lot of good reviews about Dr. Aspacio.\n\nWhen he came in to the exam room, he seemed rushed and acted like I was taking up his time by telling him my dermatological history. I told him that I had tried a certain medication for my acne, but didn't like it because it made my skin raw and peely, and asked if he could make a suggestion for another solution. So what does he prescribe? That same medicine I had just told him I didn't. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer initially mentions finding good reviews and researching the dermatologist, the vast majority of the text details a frustrating and disrespectful experience. The reviewer explicitly describes the doctor as ""rude,"" expresses feeling ""uncomfortable,"" and emphasizes the lack of listening and dismissive attitude. The act of throwing out the prescription further highlights the negative sentiment. The concluding sentence reinforces the negative experience and contrasts it with a positive outcome from another dermatologist.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: This location of Jimmy John's is a regular lunch stop when I am working in the Northwest. Clean shop, friendly staff, quick service.\n\nI love turkey, I don't like ham or super salty meats (read: Italian meats) on my sandwiches (except bacon of course!). Jimmy John's has a nice selection of sandwiches with turkey on them. Here are my faves:\n\nTurkey Tom - simple...turkey, cheese, regular fixins\nBeach Club - turkey, cheese, avo, cukes, sprouts...a California Girl's sandwich dream\nClub Lulu - turkey, bacon, regular fixins\nBootlegger - turkey, roast beef, regular fixins\n\nFresh ingredients, good portion of meat (for me), lots of veggies, extra peppers. Reasoning: The review expresses clear enjoyment of the Jimmy John's location, highlighting positive aspects like cleanliness, friendly staff, quick service, and a good selection of turkey-based sandwiches which the reviewer explicitly states they ""love."" The reviewer also details specific sandwich preferences and praises the freshness of the ingredients and portion sizes. The language is overwhelmingly positive, with phrases like ""a California Girl's sandwich dream"" and ""Quality sandwich place"" indicating strong satisfaction.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Ugh. Got the Italian Night Club to go. Asked for the mayo and dressing on the side. Was told they are not able to do that. They have no Dixie cups. Really? They finally found something to put it in. Shouldn't have bothered anyway. Was just oil n vinegar. Made my own dressing at home. Bun was a glorified hot dog bun. Smh.. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer uses words like ""Ugh,"" and ""Really?"" to express frustration. They specifically highlight multiple failures – inability to accommodate a simple request (dressing on the side), lack of basic supplies (Dixie cups), a disappointing substitute, and a low-quality bun. The concluding statement ""Shouldn't have bothered anyway"" seals the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I used to love the veggie sandwiches here until I found out what I was supporting by eating here. Jimmy John is one of those people that use their money for evil. He pays a lot of the money that comes from this chain to go to Africa and shoot exotic animals. Beautiful elephants and cheetahs. Google it if you need to see for yourselves. Sandwiches are not that damn good. I'm disgusted. Boycott JJ.. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. While it initially mentions a past enjoyment of the sandwiches, the core of the review focuses on expressing disgust and advocating for a boycott due to the owner’s alleged actions. The language used is strongly negative (""evil,"" ""disgusted,"" ""boycott,"" ""not that damn good"") and conveys a clear disapproval far outweighing any prior positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I would rather go to Walmart on Christmas Eve than go to this Kmart at its slowest time. Took me 40 minutes and four employees to get the item I ordered online to pick up in store. Did I mention the ten minute wait to even get someone to the help counter because the 8 cashiers they had were too enthralled in a riveting conversation.... Never again.. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer uses extremely harsh language (""I would rather go to Walmart on Christmas Eve""), expresses frustration with excessive wait times (40 minutes, 10 minutes), criticizes employee behavior (""riveting conversation""), and ends with a definitive ""Never again."" These all point to a very poor customer experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Both dr Martin and swainston are amazing but they are way overcrowded. I'm a little concerned about getting seen and what will happen when I go into labor. When you do see them thy give you their full attention.. Reasoning: The review expresses both positive and negative sentiments. The reviewer explicitly praises Dr. Martin and Swainston (""amazing""), indicating a positive experience with the medical professionals themselves. However, the overcrowding and concerns about being seen and labor care introduce significant negative aspects. The praise is somewhat tempered by the logistical problems. Overall, the negativity surrounding the practical aspects leans the review towards a less positive experience.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: This trip to the ER was the worst I've ever experienced. I'll spare you the gory details and just give the highlights. \n\nWhen checking me in they did everything but call me a liar. They treated me like a junky trying to get some painkillers. They shrugged off my discharge papers from Urgent Care. I sat in the waiting room for a total of 4 hours. I got an external and intra-vaginal ultrasound, just to hear the CT Scan guy talking to another ultrasound guy about how I wasn't actually in pain at all. They insisted on giving me a. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer details a series of extremely negative experiences, including accusations of dishonesty from staff, dismissive treatment, excessive wait times, inappropriate procedures, and misdiagnosis. The language used is highly critical and conveys a strong sense of frustration, anger, and distress. The concluding statement ""Never again"" reinforces the intensely negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Well we waited for a room to open in the ICU. My bf is nearly having a heart attack in one of the rooms of the ER. One of the nurses comes in the room, gets on the phone and describes to the person on the other line that she has a \""train wreck\"" coming through. Aka my bf. Nice.. Reasoning: This review expresses extreme distress and negativity. The language used – “waited for a room in the ICU,” “nearly having a heart attack,” “train wreck” – paints a picture of a dire and chaotic situation. The sarcastic ""Nice"" at the end further emphasizes the negative experience and frustration with the care being received. This is far from a positive experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Wanted to try Beach Pizza, since it's closer than the place I usually go to, Roccos NY Pizza. Large 3 item Pizza, chicken parm sub, and an order of buffalo wings. \nThe whole order of food, was sub-par, at best. The buffalo wings, were terrible, smelled weird, oily, little wing sauce, ate a few, dumped the rest. The Chicken Parm sub was mushy with too little chicken and too much sauce and cheese. The pizza was kinda like Dominos, cardboardy crust, not the worst ever, but far from good. For the prices, not a real good value. For 1/2 the. Reasoning: The review overwhelmingly focuses on negative experiences with the food. While the staff and service are acknowledged as positive, the primary focus is on the poor quality of the pizza, wings, and sub. Descriptors like ""sub-par,"" ""terrible,"" ""weird,"" ""oily,"" ""mushy,"" and ""cardboardy"" are heavily critical. The concluding statement, ""Will not return,"" seals the negative classification. The mention of comparable pricing with Domino's further emphasizes a perception of low quality for the cost.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: *No one wears gloves here* I came here the evening of Friday Nov. 21, to get some pizza, fast. I asked the girl at the register How much a large cheese pizza is. She said \""That'll be $12.92\"". I asked how much 2 medium cheese pizzas are, she said \""$12.95\"". I ordered the two pizzas, paid, and said I'd be back. The girl at the register told me it would be 15-20 minutes.\n I returned to a line of two people, less than 15 minutes later. I waited in the line for over 10 minutes, staring at my pizzas that. Reasoning: This review expresses significant negative sentiment. While the pizza itself is described as ""average,"" the primary focus is on a deeply concerning hygiene issue: employees handling food with bare hands. The reviewer explicitly highlights this, noting a lack of gloves among all employees observed. The long wait time despite pre-payment and the lack of recognition from the cashier also contribute to the negative experience. The concluding line, ""None of us have the stomach flu yet,"" is a darkly humorous comment indicating apprehension and dissatisfaction.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: This use to be one of my favorite pizza places till it took over an hour for my Delivery to get to me and then they charged my credit card and when it got to me they tried to make me pay cash when I already paid. I'm not happy with the service I have received from them and this will be the last time I order from them. I don't feel it is Appropriate to charge your customers twic. Reasoning: The review expresses significant dissatisfaction with the service received. Phrases like ""I'm not happy,"" ""this will be the last time I order,"" and the complaint about being charged twice clearly indicate a negative experience. The reviewer explicitly states their disappointment and expresses a loss of previous positive feelings (""use to be one of my favorite"").. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I love Roberto's and this happens to be right by my house so I come here all the time. The food always comes out fast and they always get my order right.\n\nThis location is old and the decor is dumpy ...but I don't go to Robertos for the ambiance.. Reasoning: The reviewer explicitly states they ""love Roberto's"" and visit frequently. While they acknowledge the decor is ""dumpy,"" they also state they don't visit for the ambiance, effectively dismissing that negative aspect. The positive mentions of speed and order accuracy further solidify the positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: What can I say...this used to be my regular as it was cheaper for dinner for two here than cooking on your own. It's still OK. Full of Dell Web residents if you get there for an early dinner. Love Mirna, the waitress that has been there for years!. Reasoning: The review contains mixed signals. While it acknowledges a past positive (""used to be my regular,"" ""cheaper""), it now only describes the experience as ""OK."" The mention of Dell Web residents is observational, not inherently positive or negative. The enthusiastic praise for the waitress, Mirna, is a significant positive element. Overall, the tone leans towards a mild appreciation despite a perceived decline in value or experience.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: I would give negative stars if possible. Absolute worst experience ever. I contacted Wardley real estate because I found a house I was interested in while browsing on realtors.com. I contacted the listing agent. And was linked up with the worst realtor ever Greg Hicks. He was the most unprofessional agent I have had to deal with. Not once during the Three month period of my short sale did he contact me to update me on anything. I had to call him and when I did he never had an answer for me he always said \"" I'm going to. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer uses extremely strong, negative language throughout, including phrases like ""negative stars,"" ""absolute worst experience ever,"" ""worst realtor ever,"" ""unprofessional,"" ""never had an answer,"" ""BS,"" ""gave me the run around,"" and ""complete fail."" The reviewer details a series of significant failures in communication and service, leading to a very dissatisfied customer. Multiple individuals associated with the agency (Greg Hicks, Jennifer Hill, Jeff Sommers) are explicitly criticized.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: My husband and I go to this place mostly for the monday special which is a half chicken dinner now priced at 7.49. When it was 5.99 years ago, half of Sun City were lining up out the doors. Now I guess the place is just not as packed. \n\nWe decided to have a BURGER instead of the chicken. However, they have TWO parts to the burger section on the menu. One is a Make your own additions to the burger each 50 cents for $5.99 and another section below for different prices which come from 7.99 and up. These. Reasoning: The review expresses significant disappointment and frustration. While acknowledging the Monday special used to be a good value, the core experience with the burger was overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer details issues like the minimal cheese, dryness, thinness despite being advertised as 1/2 pound, and unexpected extra charges for seemingly standard toppings. The final statement ""will NEVER order a burger there again!"" is a strong indicator of negative sentiment. The language used (""rip off"", ""very dry"", ""minimal cheese"") further reinforces this.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: This is a nice BK. The building has been remodeled and looks great. The inside is pretty and looks very modern. They have the usual seating as well as a little cove with couches and cushy seats to sit and have a coffee. The playground area is nice and big. It is 2 stories with a lot of room for the kiddos to run around in. There is pretty limited seating for adults though with only 3 tables available. Another bonus was the new automated soda machine. I love these machines and the abundance of soda choices. Yummy! Overall it. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive. While the reviewer mentions limited seating for adults, this is a minor drawback presented alongside numerous positives like the remodeled building, modern interior, comfortable seating options (couches!), a large playground, and a new soda machine. The concluding statement explicitly states it's a ""nice BK as compared to the others,"" solidifying the positive sentiment. The use of words like ""great,"" ""pretty,"" ""nice,"" ""yummy,"" and ""bonus"" all contribute to the positive tone.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Worst doctor office. Do not go here. Very rude costumer service and do not care about patient health. By far one of the worst experiences I have ever had.. Reasoning: The review uses extremely negative language including phrases like ""Worst doctor office,"" ""Do not go here,"" ""Very rude,"" ""do not care about patient health,"" and ""one of the worst experiences."" The overall tone is highly critical and expresses strong dissatisfaction.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I would give them zero stars if it were possible. \n\nMy wife tore her ACL on a Saturday, went to the ER. Visited her PCP the following business day to get a referral. SW Medical sent her here. They initially told her they couldn't see her until FOUR MONTHS LATER!!!! I fought through their BS after hours of hold times and finally got an appointment to see someone three weeks after the injury, only to have them cancel on her the business day before the appointment. What A-holes! They pretty much told us to go F ourselves....What is the reason. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer uses extremely strong, derogatory language (""A-holes,"" ""go F ourselves""), describes a frustrating and dismissive experience with the staff, and details significant appointment cancellations and refusal of service due to a contractual issue. While the reviewer acknowledges a degree of unfairness due to not receiving treatment, the core narrative is one of terrible customer service and a deeply negative interaction. The strong emotional language and the explicit recommendation to avoid the clinic solidify the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I had dinner here this week, and while waiting for my dine-in order, I checked on here to see what people had to say.\n\nMy response? \""Oh, crap.\""\n\nFortunately for me, I didn't have the customer service nightmare that other reviewers had. So that leads me to believe that the issue must be either with: take-out, delivery, or someone that works here got the memo and decided to work on their customer service techniques.\n\nIf anything, the service was very friendly. Quick, talkative, checked in often to see how we were doing... they even stopped us when we went to select our drinks. Reasoning: While the review starts with a negative reaction (""Oh, crap"" referencing other reviews), the overall tone quickly shifts to a positive experience. The reviewer explicitly states the service was ""very friendly,"" highlights several positive interactions (checking in, offering colder drinks), and praises the food (""really tasty 'zas,"" ""mighty fine wings""). The only caveat, the price, is presented as a minor point considering the quality. The reviewer’s relief at their positive experience compared to others indicates a generally favorable impression.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Best pizza I've found in Summerlin. Lots of fresh toppings and great flavor. Not the cheapest pizza, but worth it.. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language (""Best pizza,"" ""fresh toppings,"" ""great flavor,"" ""worth it""). While it notes the pizza isn't the cheapest, this is presented as a minor consideration and doesn't detract from the overall positive experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Very happy with their pizza. It's my favorite in the city. The staff is nice and they know what they're doing. The owner is also very nice.. Reasoning: The review uses overtly positive language like ""Very happy,"" ""favorite,"" and ""very nice."" It praises both the product (pizza) and the service (staff and owner). There are no negative statements or criticisms present.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Stopped in for a few slices after not dining here for several months because the pizza was so bad, and now I remember why I stopped eating here !! The pizza was soggy soaked in grease and just not good. The Pizza is just plain bad here, and even though this place is less then a minute from my house I will not be dining here anymore .... Reasoning: The review uses extremely negative language. Phrases like ""so bad,"" ""soggy soaked in grease,"" ""not good,"" ""plain bad,"" and ""will not be dining here anymore"" clearly indicate a highly unsatisfactory experience. The author explicitly states they stopped coming due to prior poor quality and reaffirms that reason.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: The decor is classic dark brew pub. It works. A nice place to hang with your friends or just chill by yourself.\n\nAn above average pub menu. The breakfast menu is pretty good, with lots of choices. We like it - my sweetie loves to come here.\n\nToday we showed up a bit late for breakfast, so we fastened onto the lunch menu. Again, lots of choices. I went with the \""round mountain\"" roast beef sandwich, my sweetie went with the Paradise Carnita sandwich. We both had the home made chips,,, my sandwich was okay -- it was as advertised -- but. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive. While there's a minor criticism about one sandwich being ""kinda bland,"" it's immediately qualified as a matter of personal taste and not a fault of the establishment. The reviewer explicitly praises the other sandwich as ""absolutely KILLER"" and uses enthusiastic language (""awesome choice,"" ""amazing sandwich"") throughout. They also highlight positive aspects like the decor, breakfast menu, beer selection, service, and fair prices. The overall tone expresses enjoyment and a desire to return.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Hands down the worst service I have ever received from a server in my entire life. She spoke in a very unprofessional manner and in an an impressionable way as if she thought she was some sort of savior or counselor and not a bartender. The truth of the matter is that she is a parrot and repeats complete parroted nonsense that was given to here by a drunken fool. I understand that this is a bar but if you are going to interrogate every customer that walks in as if you know their life is fact and not the. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The language is extremely harsh and filled with strong negative descriptors (""worst,"" ""utter foolish nonsense,"" ""foul mouth,"" ""shame,"" ""unprofessional""). While the reviewer acknowledges the food is good, this is completely overshadowed by the scathing critique of the staff's behavior and the perceived lack of professionalism. The length and intensity of the complaint leave no doubt about the reviewer's negative experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I recently discovered this location a month ago and am glad that is saves me a drive from the Charleston location I used to frequent. Even though this location is popular and busy I've always been able to find a seat with minimal wait times. I was satisfied that it was clean, specials were communicated on the chalk board as soon as you walk in, and everyone is really friendly.\n\nWhat I really enjoy here is the basic breakfast since it's one of my favorite meals, I got the ham and eggs with toast. Sure what I choose is a basic. Reasoning: The review expresses overwhelmingly positive feelings. The reviewer explicitly states they are ""glad"" about the location, describes experiences with minimal wait times and cleanliness, praises the friendly staff, and details enjoyment of the food (""loved how it's all freshly made""). The mention of friends leaving ""full and with boxes for the leftovers"" further reinforces the positive experience. The final recommendation to add the location as an option for weekend mornings solidifies the positive sentiment.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I usually love coming here for their Homemade Corned Beef Hash and Eggs but this time I was a little upset with the service. All of the times I have been here they would serve their homemade Pumpkin Bread before breakfast but I wasn't even offered any. I thought maybe they ran out so I just let it go until I heard another waitress next to me offer it to another table. I did one of these inner Grrrrr! sounds but it was already too late because I was getting full. My hot chocolate was never refilled even though I. Reasoning: While the reviewer expresses disappointment with the service (""a little upset,"" ""less than stellar""), they also state they ""usually love coming here"" and explicitly state they ""will not dwell on it."" They acknowledge the decor change as a personal preference and don't express strong negativity about it. The overall tone is more of mild disappointment rather than outright anger or dissatisfaction. The positive mention of the food (""Homemade Corned Beef Hash and Eggs"") also contributes to a less negative overall impression.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: Banana bread was delicious and the Mediterranean omelet with shrimp and lobster inside was amazing.. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Words like ""delicious"" and ""amazing"" directly express a favorable opinion about the food. There are no negative terms or criticisms present.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: As other reviewers stated, service is spotty (polite, but mostly absent, which is strange in a place this size). Food is good: omelets are LARGE - clearly can be split by 2 regular size folks. Well prepared and full of good stuff. \n\nOur sides of the banana bread and pumpkin bread were clearly warmed over which was a little embarrassing for the waitress (who danced around the subject) But the main course, which was the reason for visiting, hit the mark.\n\nNot easy to get in and out of since you pay at the register (paying during our visit turned into. Reasoning: The review presents a mixed bag of experiences. While the food is praised (large omelets, well-prepared, ""hit the mark""), the service is repeatedly criticized as ""spotty"" and ""mostly absent."" The bread being warmed over is also a negative. The payment process being difficult is another drawback. However, the final ""A-OK"" suggests a generally acceptable experience, tempering the negatives. Considering the balance of positive and negative points, the overall sentiment leans slightly positive, but with significant reservations.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I've been going to Gold's Gym for a couple months now, and I can say, it's the best gym I've tried in town. I'm a former member of LVAC and 24 Hour, and my experience here is much better.\n\nFirst off, it's $19 a month. No contract. Very affordable and you aren't locked into a 27(?) month plan like LVAC. You can add amenities like tanning, child care, etc...but I have no need for those.\n\nAlso, unlike LVAC, it's never too busy. Yes, from around 8-noon, and again from 4-7 it can be busier than normal, but I've never waited for a. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer explicitly states it's the ""best gym I've tried in town"" and compares it favorably to more expensive alternatives (LVAC and 24 Hour Fitness). They highlight numerous positives: affordability, lack of contracts, manageable crowding, good equipment variety, a positive class experience, and a friendly atmosphere. While they mention a minor issue with equipment maintenance (leading to a star deduction), this is presented as a small complaint and doesn't overshadow the numerous positive aspects. The concluding remarks reinforce the positive impression.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: This was my home gym for a while. Until they switched up management. The place has fallen apart. Manager is rude. Machines are old. It's simply not kept up anymore. Sad because it WAS such a great gym, people were serious about working out there. If you live in the NW area take your money to lvac over the bridge, there is plenty room and equipment and cleaner.. Reasoning: The review expresses significant disappointment and negativity. While acknowledging a positive past (""It WAS such a great gym""), the reviewer details a decline in quality due to management changes, citing rudeness, outdated equipment, and lack of upkeep. The strong language (""fallen apart,"" ""rude"") and the explicit recommendation to go elsewhere (""take your money to lvac"") clearly indicate a negative experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I come here M-Friday. Parking lot can become a nightmare and place is a little small But I come between 2:00-3:30 maybe till 4 and theres less people. I like that they have a side for only women that's a nice feature for people who are easily intimated or shy. Staff or people that come here are not snobby and bathrooms are clean. i pay 20 a month and no contract I can attend the fitness classes at that price if I wished.. Reasoning: While the review mentions some drawbacks (parking being a nightmare, the place being small), the overall tone is positive. The reviewer consistently returns to the location multiple times a week (""M-Friday""), highlighting a positive experience. They appreciate the women-only area, the non-snobby atmosphere, clean bathrooms, and the affordability with no contract. The negatives are presented as minor inconveniences rather than dealbreakers.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I've had two major repair jobs done here and both made me a bit uncomfortable, so I'm not planning to return. Their only diagnosis tool seems to be the computer reporting tool, This leads to things like wanting to replace an entire part of your car (the entire ignition system, transmission, etc.) if they can't identify a [trivial] problem.\n\nWhile they've never done anything that made me suspect they were suggesting things to run up my bill, it seems more like they don't know how to diagnose the specific problem and just 'ripp it out and replace it all' is their. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer states they haven't experienced outright scams, the language used is highly critical. Phrases like ""made me a bit uncomfortable,"" ""don't know how to diagnose the specific problem,"" ""ripp it out and replace it all,"" ""prices are on the high,"" and ""extremely slow"" clearly express dissatisfaction. The comparison to barely above a one-star review solidifies the negative sentiment. Even the offered free repairs are presented negatively as a reaction to initial overcharging.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I came here for a routine oil change... they came back and shoved a bunch of unwanted information at me saying I need to have X and Y changed. The repairs would cost me over 2000, so I said no. Aside from making me feel stupid, when I went to check my oil a couple months later, I realized some screws were missing from underneath the hood. The ones that were there weren't secured properly. And somehow my hood prop rod also magically broke somehow. \n\nAlso, I came here once before that (this is before I noticed the missing pieces). Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer details multiple instances of feeling pressured into unnecessary and expensive repairs, feeling belittled by the staff, and discovering evidence of shoddy workmanship (missing screws, improperly secured parts, broken prop rod). The concluding statement (""Sub par service and work. I will never come here again"") leaves no room for interpretation. The language used is highly critical and expresses strong dissatisfaction.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: The restaurant was closed to the efforts of the anti-smoking Nazi's. The beer is still great but I miss the food.. Reasoning: While the reviewer acknowledges the beer is still great (a positive), the overall tone is overwhelmingly negative. The phrasing ""closed to the efforts of the anti-smoking Nazi's"" is highly critical and conveys significant displeasure with the reason for the restaurant's closure. The statement ""I miss the food"" reinforces a negative sentiment, indicating a loss and disappointment. The aggressive language used elevates the negativity beyond a simple expression of dissatisfaction.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Been back a few times since my first review and on a recent visit came for a going away party. \n\nThis was a really good easy going venue to do that. There is plenty of seating, there are billiards, games so everyone could interact. It wasn't overly smoky and it was quiet to carry on conversation. Of course the one downside is there isn't any food, but we had pizza delivered to the spot and they have no problems with people bringing in food. The bartenders here are friendly and actually try to talk to patrons. \n\nEvery beer they brew. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive. The author explicitly states ""This was a really good easy going venue,"" praises the ample seating, games, lack of excessive smoke, quiet atmosphere, friendly bartenders, and beer selection. While mentioning the lack of food, they immediately offer a workaround and highlight the venue's flexibility. The overall tone is enthusiastic and recommends the spot.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Horrible. Just plain horrible. Like the other review, get one star cause I have to. Ordered a small chili with cheese. Asked for some chili sauce packets on the side. A spicy chicken sandwich combo with a side of ranch. The wifey was nice enough to get it in the first place, so I can't complain to her. No ranch. No chili sauce. No spoon to eat the chili. No straw for the drink. No napkins to wipe hands with. Did get ketchup for the fries, but didn't eat them because they were colder than the ice in my drink.. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer uses extremely strong negative language (""Horrible,"" ""soooooo angry"") and details a long list of failures in the order and service. While the manager attempted a resolution, the lack of a refund or gift card, coupled with the declaration of never returning, solidifies the deeply negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I'd give this a score of 3 1/2 if I could. Good quality beer. I rated each one 3.75 out of 5 on both BeerAdvocate and Untappd. I was really looking forward to the oatmeal stout, but they were out. Maybe next time. \n\nThere's no food, but good atmosphere and friendly staff.. Reasoning: While the reviewer initially expresses disappointment about the oatmeal stout being unavailable (""I was really looking forward to...but they were out""), the overall tone is quite positive. They explicitly praise the beer quality (""Good quality beer""), rate it highly on beer rating platforms (3.75/5), and highlight positive aspects like the atmosphere and friendly staff. The 3.75 rating (or the desire for it) also suggests a generally favorable experience. The missing stout is presented as a minor setback rather than a major complaint.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I love this Wendy's. I have been coming here over the years and never had any problems. my order is always right and piping hot fresh. \n\nThe drive-thru is super speedy and the workers are always friendly. \n\nI recently have become addicted to the chili cheese fries. \n\nYou can't beat there value menu with so many tasty options.\n\nThey regularly send coupons in the mail and all of them or worth using. I got a free spicy chicken sandwich with purchase of a small drink and fries and also I liked the coupon where I got a free chili cheese fries. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses enthusiastic language like ""I love this Wendy's,"" consistently praises the food quality (""piping hot fresh,"" ""tasty options""), service (""super speedy,"" ""friendly""), and value. They specifically highlight multiple positive experiences with coupons and express clear enjoyment of the chili cheese fries. There are no negative aspects mentioned at all.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: My rule of thumb lately is not to review fast food locations unless they meet following criteria. Service is outstanding or food is amazing. Or my service was horrible etc. I am writing this review in hope management sees this, cause this will freak out alot of people. I ordered some stuff to go. I got burgers and a raspberry tea witch sounded good honestly. The burgers where average bacon was burnt like deep fryer bacon. That wasn't the fries where cold. And the topper I started drinking the drink on the way home witch is like 5 mins even. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer states they don't want reimbursement and ultimately express hope management will see their feedback, the core of the review details a series of significant problems. These include burnt bacon, cold fries, a drink containing unusual, hard chunks of unknown origin (suggesting a quality control issue), and the accompanying anxiety caused by the unknown substance. The repeated emphasis on the issues and the worry about what was ingested strongly indicate a negative experience. The initial disclaimer about only reviewing exceptional or terrible experiences also foreshadows a negative assessment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: $6 exterior car wash, and you can find a $2 off coupon online. Makes for a cheap car wash, except I have to get out of my car to dry off my car after it's been \""dried.\"" You get what you pay for!. Reasoning: The review highlights a low price point (""cheap car wash"") which is initially positive. However, the core complaint revolves around the car not being properly dried, requiring the customer to do it themselves, undermining the value proposition. The concluding phrase ""You get what you pay for!"" is a resigned acceptance of a low-quality service, indicating dissatisfaction despite the affordability. This suggests a generally negative experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: What the hell. I gave the guy $20 and the gas would only fill up to $19.89.\n\nIt's not about the 11 cents, but the principle of the matter. From my experience, most gas pumps stop before it gets to the full value, but you can always keep pumping until it gets there. This was not the case with this one. The trigger was loose and just wouldn't go anymore. That's kinda fucked up if you ask me.. Reasoning: The review expresses significant frustration and anger. The language used (""What the hell,"" ""kinda fucked up"") clearly indicates a negative experience. The reviewer focuses on a feeling of being cheated, even if the amount is small, highlighting a breach of trust and a feeling of being taken advantage of.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Just okay. My husbsnd hated it but I thought it would do in a pinch, but haven't been back in months. Soups need improvement. Staff was nice.. Reasoning: The review contains mixed signals. While the staff is praised (""nice""), the overall impression is lukewarm. Phrases like ""Just okay,"" ""husbands hated it,"" ""would do in a pinch,"" and ""soups need improvement"" indicate dissatisfaction. The lack of a return visit (""haven't been back in months"") reinforces a lack of enthusiasm. The positive comment about the staff isn't enough to outweigh the negative aspects.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: This place is sub par. The service is great and the staff are really friendly but the food is only edible at best. My wife and I caught an early dinner here last night. The decor was dated and the other patrons were all probably from Sun City, but whatever. We ordered the dinner special which comes with soup, appetizers and two main courses. We received the wonton soup first which was bland. Then we got out appetizers that consisted of fried wontons, fried shrimp and egg rolls. They were a bit greasy but edible. Finally came our main course. Reasoning: While the reviewer praises the service and staff friendliness, the overwhelming majority of the review focuses on negative aspects of the food. Phrases like ""sub par,"" ""edible at best,"" ""bland,"" ""greasy,"" ""flavorless,"" and descriptions of unusual and disappointing tastes dominate the text. The reviewer explicitly states their disappointment and ultimately concedes the food was not good, despite their desire to like the restaurant. The positive mentions are significantly outweighed by the negative commentary on the food itself, which is a primary factor in dining experiences.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I have been going here since I was a little kid. The food had always been consistent and delicious. Even if I haven't been there in a while, the waitress always recognizes me and knows my order. BEST WONTON SOUP EVER!. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""consistent and delicious,"" ""BEST WONTON SOUP EVER!"" and the mention of being recognized by the waitress indicating a personalized and positive experience all point towards a very favorable opinion. There are no negative comments or criticisms present.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: This is place is clean the server is very attentive. Food was brought to us within 10/15 after we placed the order. Came for the lunch special they're priced very well. Will definitely come back. Delicious!!. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Phrases like ""clean,"" ""very attentive,"" ""priced very well,"" ""definitely come back,"" and ""delicious"" clearly indicate a favorable experience. There are no negative comments or criticisms present.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: When I made my appointment and asked for the address of the office I was told it was on Windmill and Pacos, when I asked for an address the man on the other end said its on Windmill and Pacos, that's all you need. Then when I got the reminder phone call the day before the appionmtnt, the lady leaving the message said, at the end, \"" oh, and it's $25 for a no show/no call\"" and hung up. I thought that was a little rude on top of the address thing, THEN on the day of the appointment....my appointment. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer details multiple instances of poor customer service, including conflicting information about the address, a rude message regarding no-show fees, and ultimately being refused service despite arriving only slightly late. The reviewer explicitly states they are taking their business elsewhere and describes the staff as ""extremely rude."" While they acknowledge the doctor may be good, the negative experiences with the staff completely overshadow any potential positives.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I've been taking my cats to Dr. Steelman for 15 years. I was always a huge fan of her work in the community. I am deeply disappointed in my last dealings with that place and Dr. Steelman. My cat was very ill, and you NEVER can reach anyone there. They NEVER return your phone calls. You wait HOURS to pick them up. Then when you do, if your cat is still sick, and you have questions, THEY STILL DON'T return your calls. HOW SCARY. The receptionist keeps saying we are VERY busy. SO is the VA hospital and people DIE!. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer acknowledges a long history of positive feelings towards Dr. Steelman and her work, the core of the review details a deeply distressing and ultimately tragic experience. The language used is highly critical (""deeply disappointed,"" ""HOW SCARY,"" ""NEVER GO BACK""), emphasizing communication failures, long wait times, and the heartbreaking loss of a beloved pet. The comparison to the VA hospital and the pointed questioning of the clinic’s mission statement further solidify the negative tone. The inclusion of the pet's death is a particularly strong indicator of negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Wow-wee-wow! I didn't hate this place; I sure liked it a lot better than the previous reviewer (Tiger W.), but it was rather mundane.... 'ho-hum', if you will. Not terrible at all, just nothing special. Good if you're hungry and not looking for a fancy-schmancy experience. I recommend on those terms. Good price.. Reasoning: The review contains a lot of mixed signals. While the reviewer explicitly states they ""liked it a lot better"" than another reviewer and says it's ""not terrible,"" the repeated use of words like ""mundane,"" ""ho-hum,"" and ""nothing special"" heavily dampen the positive aspects. The concluding recommendation is conditional (""Good if you're hungry and not looking for a fancy experience"") further indicating a lack of enthusiasm. The price being ""good"" is a minor positive, but doesn’t outweigh the overall feeling of mediocrity.. Final Sentiment: neutral",neutral
"Review: This is a good sushi bar. Other reviews say the fish is fresh and they weren't joking. Its a small place with not much ambience, but if you're going there for good sushi, you won't be disappointed.. Reasoning: The review explicitly states ""This is a good sushi bar"" and emphasizes the freshness of the fish, a key indicator of quality. While it acknowledges a lack of ambiance (a minor drawback), the overall message focuses on the positive attribute of good sushi, concluding with ""you won't be disappointed."" This overwhelmingly positive assessment outweighs the slight negative comment about the atmosphere.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: This sushi place is great! The rolls were fresh and very tasty!! We also received a complimentary appetizer and a sushi sample, which was a nice surprise! Customer service was great and the food was delicious. \n\nThey don't offer AYCE, but the 4 rolls me and my friend shared were more than enough. I'll make sure to come back here again!. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language. Words and phrases like ""great,"" ""fresh,"" ""very tasty,"" ""nice surprise,"" ""great customer service,"" and ""delicious"" clearly indicate a positive experience. The reviewer also states they will return, further solidifying the positive sentiment. The mention of not having an ""AYCE"" option is presented as a minor detail and doesn't detract from the overall positive impression.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: This place was good and found this on the internet. Anyways I wished I had the sushi, but I was sick so I went with the noodles which was good. It was nice and hot and filled my belly. I loved the salad as well. I wished I had the other dishes, but it is okay though. I would come back here again.. Reasoning: While the reviewer expresses a slight disappointment about not being able to have sushi (""I wished I had the sushi""), the overall tone is positive. They explicitly state the noodles were ""good,"" enjoyed the salad, and describe the food as ""nice and hot"" and ""filled my belly."" The concluding statement ""I would come back here again"" is a strong indicator of a positive experience. The minor regret about the unavailable sushi doesn't overshadow the positive aspects.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: The sushi here is SO good. My favorites include the Japanese lasagna and the vegetable fried rice. The miso soup is also yummy. Happy hour here is pretty good too, and if you do check in through yelp, you get a free bottle of sake (i have not cashed that in yet). \nThey used to have real scallops for their happy hour fried scallop dish, but last night when i was there, it was imitation scallops.....almost tasted like imitation crab meat, only rolled into a scallop shape. Perhaps an oversight, perhaps a permanent change? Who knows....\n\nThe service is friendly, and. Reasoning: While the review mentions a disappointing change regarding the fried scallops (imitation instead of real), the overwhelming tone is positive. The reviewer explicitly states the sushi is ""SO good,"" praises multiple dishes, appreciates the friendly and accommodating service, and expresses intent to return ""numerous times."" The negative point about the scallops is presented as a question/observation rather than a harsh criticism, and doesn't overshadow the overall positive experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: We ate here a month ago on a Saturday night with my daughter and had an great time at the sushi bar eating and talking to the chefs. Tonight (after the hostess took phone calls while people were waiting) she told us children can't sit at the sushi bar on the weekends, so we left. Honestly, it seemed like a lie so she could send us to a table. It's upsetting because the food is good. But after being treated the way we were I'll never go back - with or without my daughter.. Reasoning: While the reviewer acknowledges the food is good (""the food is good""), the overwhelmingly negative experience with the hostess and the abrupt change in policy regarding children at the sushi bar significantly outweighs the positive. The phrases ""upsetting,"" ""treated the way we were,"" and ""I'll never go back"" clearly indicate a strong negative sentiment. The initial positive experience is ultimately overshadowed by the frustrating and dismissive treatment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Best sushi in town. Sad it's such a small location because I'm impatient when it comes to waiting! The Green Valley is my personal favorite!. Reasoning: While the reviewer expresses frustration about the wait time (a negative), the overwhelmingly positive statement ""Best sushi in town"" and the enthusiastic endorsement of a specific roll (""The Green Valley is my personal favorite!"") indicate a largely positive experience. The negative comment is presented as a minor inconvenience rather than a significant detractor.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: What can I say but awesome! A bit pricey but the best sushi in town. They have some of the freshest seafood of any sushi restaurant I've ever been to.. Reasoning: The review uses overwhelmingly positive language (""awesome,"" ""best,"" ""freshest""). While it mentions the price as ""a bit pricey,"" this is a minor criticism overshadowed by the strong praise for the sushi and seafood quality. The overall tone expresses high satisfaction.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: My man and I go to Yummy grill about twice per week. Everyone I bring ends up becoming a regular. The fish is the freshest and best high quality selection in Vegas- bar none! Eric is the bomb. You WILL NOT be disappointed!!! My man came in eating california rolls and now he's a sashimi buff. Thank god for this place. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses enthusiastic language (""Yummy grill,"" ""the bomb,"" ""You WILL NOT be disappointed!!!""), highlights exceptional quality (""freshest and best high quality selection""), and expresses a strong sense of satisfaction (""Thank god for this place""). The fact that they visit frequently and convert others into regulars further emphasizes a positive experience.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: Upon the chef's recommendation, a medium size sashimi plate was served. However, it is unsatisfactory to my standard. \nThe temperature of the sashimi was slightly warmer than it should be; I couldn't even breakdown the tendon part of the fish by chewing. (1/5)\n\nI didn't enjoy the dash of the kimchi sauce on one of the fish; it desensitized your taste bud to the fish. \n\nWasabi was either those tube or the power mixed; I expected fresh wasabi with this price. (2.5/5)\n\nThe miso soup ,which was water down too much for taste, was complimented with tofu cube and wakame (seaweed). (2.5/5)\n\nAge. Reasoning: This review is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer mentions satisfactory service, the vast majority of the feedback focuses on significant issues with the food. The reviewer explicitly states the sashimi was unsatisfactory, criticizes the temperature, taste combinations (kimchi sauce, aged tofu sauce), and the quality of ingredients (wasabi). The chipped plate introduces a serious sanitation concern. The low ratings given to each individual dish (2/5, 2.5/5, 2/5) and the overall negative tone surrounding the food quality make it clear the experience was disappointing. The final comment about trying hot dishes suggests a hope for a better experience, further implying the. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: I do not understand why this place has so many good reviews. I usually give a place a second try if I have a first bad experience but the food was that bad that I will never return. \n\nI was here for dinner late night on a Friday. It was refreshing to not see an AYCE sushi place. I had read reviews of how fresh the fish was. I had high hopes that this place was good since it's not too far from home. \n\nDinner consisted of mainly nigiri and a few rolls. The sushi rice was horrific. Very mushy. Reasoning: The review expresses strong dissatisfaction. Phrases like ""food was that bad that I will never return,"" ""horrific,"" ""very inconsistent,"" and ""did not seem fresh at all"" clearly indicate a negative experience. The initial hope and expectation (mentioning high hopes and being refreshing) only serve to highlight the disappointment. The reviewer's definitive statement of not recommending the place solidifies the negative sentiment.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Amazing tasting sushi. Fresh. Artistic food. Friendly service. Very busy place but worth the waiting (10-20 minutes) for rolls. \nThe reason I did not give 5 stars: The communication between the server and chefs. Orders were being missed on tickets due to the high volume of orders. The server and chefs were aware and were constantly checking in on each other to make sure orders were executed appropriately.. Reasoning: The review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses strong positive descriptors like ""Amazing tasting,"" ""Fresh,"" and ""Artistic."" They explicitly state the experience was ""worth the waiting."" While the issue with order communication is a negative point, it’s presented as a consequence of high volume and acknowledged as being actively addressed by the staff. The reviewer's overall tone leans towards satisfaction and appreciation for the food and service. The deduction of a single star doesn't negate the numerous positive aspects highlighted.. Final Sentiment: positive",positive
"Review: I am curious. Is Quest Diagnostics such an evil company that it brings out the worst in its employees???? \n\nIf you do not like to deal with people, look for another job!!!!! \n\nQuest employees are just downright mean and condescending.\n\nI dislike this evil corporation.. Reasoning: The review uses extremely negative language (""evil company,"" ""worst in its employees,"" ""mean and condescending,"" ""dislike this evil corporation""). It directly accuses the company and its employees of negative behavior and expresses strong disapproval. There are no positive aspects mentioned.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
"Review: Dr Sikand sent me to have a lump diagnosed for cancer but they ordered the wrong test. They told me I had to have another test but they weren't sure if my insurance will pay for it. 2 weeks later they still don't know. Their lack of communication and failure to order testing correctly is unacceptable. I cannot recommend this doctor to anyone.. Reasoning: This review expresses significant frustration and disappointment. The reviewer details serious errors (ordering the wrong test, uncertainty about insurance coverage, lack of communication) that caused them considerable stress and inconvenience. The language used (""unacceptable,"" ""cannot recommend"") clearly indicates a strongly negative experience.. Final Sentiment: negative",negative
